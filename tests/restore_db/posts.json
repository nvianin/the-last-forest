        "selftext": "I've been reading some batty shit here recently. It's annoying.\n\nThe world is both massively more complicated and massively more simple than conspiracy theories suggest. You insult the world by making it something it's not. (To clarify, I’m not saying it’s impossible that powerful people do shitty things, but this does not mean pizza parlors in DC. Nuance, people, nuance!)\n\nThe minute anyone says \"this is The One Truth,\" and that truth is something that feels intuitive, distrust the hell out of yourself. No one has all the answers. You are not some genius uncovering big secrets that will solve the chaos of the living, especially if the big secret in question is commonly Capitalized Like This. If you *were* a genius, you'd probably have a PhD (edit: or some other supposedly-hard-to-obtain fancy thing, or not) and I'd be reading your papers and you'd have awards and acclaim. And this is fine.\n\nIf you feel bad about not being gd Ramanujan, remind yourself that not being brilliant has no bearing on anyone's worth as a human being. (Meh_thoughts123 said, and it was so--the billionth fucking day lol.) If you find yourself wanting to feel extra special-y smart and knowledgeable, go get a few degrees. If you can't emotionally handle something, find a therapist and learn better coping skills. I very much understand the desire to want answers, reasons, know what is good vs bad, find greater meaning, resist the terror of death, whatever, but contradictions are built into the world's foundation. Don't be a coward about the whole thing and cop out with conspiracy theories.\n\nThe topic that this subreddit revolves around is fundamentally scientific in nature. Complex systems and ecology. It's measurable. Our interactions in aggregate form the world around us, and the world forms us. Since we seek resources and the earth has finite resources, this can end up being a tad tricky. (Elinor Ostrom had some great ideas about preserving the commons, but we're not quite there, are we Elinor?)\n\nEdit: I obviously ruffled some feathers with the intelligence comments. Not everyone who is really smart is going to get a PhD, sure, but statistically most people are average. This doesn’t mean extra smart people are always right, but it also doesn’t mean YOU are right. I edited my post to reflect more nuance. \n\nSecond edit: For a demonstration of the foolish redditor in action, please note that I misspelled Elinor Ostrom's name originally. Live your truth haha",

        "selftext": "The stresses of the early covid pandemic led to a situation that needed only the spark of George Floyd’s murder to set all manner of pre-existing tensions alight in a nationwide uprising that lasted for months. For the first time since the 1960s, people took to the streets in every major city and most minor cities to protest the American police state, at the least - many police headquarters ended the year in considerably worse condition than they began it. Prior to 2020, this scenario was barely fathomable. Riots were something that mostly happened to other countries. The United States was assumed to be the redoubt of democratic stability. For those of us who have been paying attention, this was long past, or indeed it was never true. But even in more mainstream thinking we had the beginning of a paradigm shift, the lessons of which had barely been absorbed by the political layers before being forgotten again. They have largely gone back to brunch on America’s internal stability since the long summer of 2020. But the American people, like the Russian people after 1905, remember. The spell has been broken, at least outside the beltway and Wall Street. The state is an alien entity with anything but your interests at heart. And you can make it bleed. That logic is not supposed to happen in advanced western democracies, but here we are. \n\nNow the movers and shakers in the financial system are using the international political situation for all it can give them and preparing a decisive confrontation with incomes and wages - the issue that has plagued the system during the entire Great Resignation. Whenever you hear that the Fed is “hawkish” on “fighting inflation” right now, make sure to translate it into plain English. This is class war. \n\nA class war during an active pandemic and the most serious geopolitical confrontation in the living memory of the vast majority of the population, a crisis which is causing a full scale collapse in key sectors of the economy around the world. \n\nSay what you want about Russia or China, but western leaders truly take the cake with the width and depth of their delusions. Argue all you want that the Russia sanctions are justified - and to give y’all your Greek earth and water, they are - but the system simply can’t afford it. This is not North Korea. This is the top global exporter for basic commodities that keep the world running. It’s like politicians and the media can’t even conceptualize the sheer magnitude of the crisis that’s building until it overshadows 2020, 2019*, 2011, and 2008 combined many times over. And that’s if they don’t fully give in to their stupidest impulses and attempt to intervene in Ukraine. When your balls are in a vise grip, you’re no less of a eunuch in the end because you pretended otherwise and stood on principle. That is exactly why Putin made this gamble. The west refuses to give in to Russian interests at its own peril. As far as Moscow cares, the west made its bed in Ukraine and the Russian army is going to make them take an L in the great game that’s being fought for some reason. In truth the west made its bed by not either welcoming or isolating Russia, but keeping it at a hostile arm’s length while exploiting its cheap resources for 25 years and sponsoring nationalism and NATO expansion on its borders. Realist anti communists like Kennan would despair at this moment. It’s entirely a western choice. Now that Russia is what it is, the financial death star of sanctions on such a target won’t prop up American power any longer, but immolate the entire world.  In truth both sides are gambling. \n\nThe west cannot fight both Russia and its own working classes at the same time, but the United States is eager to try. The price of everything is about to continue shooting up everywhere, impoverishing millions to an unprecedented degree, but our system is not only offering no solutions, but taking the opportunity to fight and win a class war. There is not a shred of Bismarckian social pragmatism left within our ruling class because that kind of thing is only gained by long experience of struggle with democratic, populist, and socialist forces of all kinds. They somehow believe in their heart of hearts that Russia has handed them the 1990s back. \n\nThe question is what happens when it finally dawns on main street that the American standard of living is going to rapidly change for the worse, with no simple “opening up” at the end of the tunnel like during the lockdowns. Other societies have long had to deal with the reality that prices may be wildly different from one outing to the next, and that shelves are sometimes bare. We haven’t. Even when the refrigerator is almost empty, like we’ve turned into a joke, stereotype, and stupid rite of passage for students and young people eating Ramen noodles, the full crushing weight of real desperation is still a distant concept. Things would get better soon for most, and most of the rest still believed. That won’t be true any longer. \n\nWill the American people plunge into the depression with steely patriotic resolve, hating Putin more and rallying around the flag for every new hardship, or will they panic, wake up, and turn on the government, if not the capitalist system itself? And who will do what? \n\n*2019 saw massive uprisings throughout Latin America that continued through 2021, notably Chile and Colombia, as well as the Middle East, and India.",

The Green Revolution came just in time to save hundreds of millions of people from starvation.\n\nBut now it would seem that our time has run out. The number of new people over past 100 years has increased our resource consumption to unsustainable levels. The global shortages are only in part due to disrupted supply chains - the main reason is that we simply cannot produce more of these things because we are at an absolute maximum allready. We cannot supply 10 Billion people - we can barely supply 8 Billion - and soon only perhaps 7 or 6 Billion.\n\nWe have reached Peak oil or are about to reach it in the coming years - so say good bye to cheap energy: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak\\_oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil)\n\nWe are about to reach peak phosphorus by around 2030 - so say good bye to all the fertilizers producting our food: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak\\_phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_phosphorus)\n\nIts not like we have an abundance of water anyway to prevent soil corossion: 1.8 billion people will be living with absolute [water scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity) by 2025, and two-thirds of the world could be subject to [water stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stress) \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak\\_water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_water)\n\nSoil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence).\"[\\[50\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture#cite_note-50) Over a billion tonnes of southern Africa's soil are being lost to erosion annually, which if continued will result in halving of crop yields within thirty to fifty years. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable\\_agriculture#Soi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture#Soil)l\n\nThe only way we could perhaps stop this is by reducing the population and consumption within the next 10 years. But since everyone is consuming more and the population is expected to grow by an additional 3 to 4 Billion by 2100 - I dont see how we should get out of this mess.\n\nAnd dont start with Green Energy - the resources required to build all those electric cars and solar panels and wind turbines are gigantic and would lead to an increased consumption of mining and resources.",

        "selftext": "I have been monitoring this war very closely, and trying to avoid the propaganda of both sides, which is about 95% of what the media shows us.\n\nIn these links, I want you all to pay more attention to what is not said, rather than officially stated positions.\n\nIt started a little bit ago, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba giving a statement about how bad things will be getting when the new Russian offensive begins in the east. I realize that many people here look at what has happened already as a \"massive\" amount of death and destruction on both sides, but for those who don't follow military history I would like to remind you that as horrifying as this has been, it is nowhere near the scale of death that a total war is capable of unleashing.\n\nThis Ukrainian minister telling everyone that the new eastern offensive by Russia will look like ww2, meaning they are going back to the kind of war Russia knows how to wage, the grind of attrition. \n\nRussia attempted a very risky salient push to try and take Kyiv. Whether they intended to take it and got their ass kicked or whether it had a deeper purpose is irrelevant. It was tried. Kyiv stands. Russian forcea pulled back. Those are the pertinent facts.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-kuleba-says-battle-donbas-will-remind-world-war-two-2022-04-07/ \n\nA newer tidbit is the US Congress finally moves to act for the long term, saying America is in it for the long haul. So, there is a long haul now? I guess the fact that Putin cannot stop is finally being given some airtime.\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/08/congress-sanction-war-putin-00023966 \n\nUS brings back the Lend-lease deal with Ukraine. Means they will be supplying a larger steady stream of material to the war. And it also means that this could be the beginning of an effort not just to allow Ukraine to defend, but to push for Russias defeat after they push them out.\n\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/lend-lease-for-ukraine-us-revives-wwii-anti-hitler-policy-to-defeat-putin/ \n\nNATO plans to permanently station a large force along borders to defend against Russian aggression. Hmmm. We should not forget basic strategy here. Having a large force in place means several things, above the stated defensive purpose. \n\nFirst, it means that someone actually thinks there is a chance that Russia might try and push into Nato territory. Devoting the money and material expense of such a deployment would not be justifiable if such an attack were deemed unlikely.\n\nAnd second, having a \"defensive\" force in place makes it very easy to switch to offensive operations later, but with no such force in place it would be much harder. Remember, Russia's forces were defensive, or just \"exercises\" before they became invaders. Should Ukraine push Russian forces out and then invate Nato into Ukraine...\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-plans-permanent-military-presence-border-says-stoltenberg-telegraph-2022-04-09/ \n\nWhite House say's Russia's admissions about heavy losses in interesting since they usually downplay them. It's not just interesting. It is something Russia would only do with purpose. Truth is, they are using the losses to galvanize the Russian people to hate the west and Ukraine, and they are getting their people ready for a justification of tactical nuclear weapons. \n\nhttps://thehill.com/news/administration/3263437-psaki-russias-admission-of-heavy-military-losses-interesting/ \n\nRussia is appointing notoriously brutal general as the new head of operations. This guy did some shit in Syria that I don't have to show here.\n\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/russia-new-general-ukraine-invasion-dvornikov/31795887.html\n\nSo, the lines are being drawn for a much bigger war, and it is a war that everyone, Russia included, knows Russia cannot win. \n\nAnd so...what does Russian doctrine say about this..?",

        "selftext": "Political tensions rise with food prices, inflation, anxiety, and War.\n\nThis is *Last Week in Collapse*, a long post I make at the end of every week, collecting some of the most important, depressing, surprising, reassuring, demoralizing, helpful, notable, timely, or otherwise must-see events in Collapse. \n\nThis is the 16th newsletter. Last week’s newsletter (April 2-8) is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/tztzmv/last_week_in_collapse_april_28_2022/) if you missed it. You can also find these newsletters [for free on SubStack](https://substack.com/profile/18092228-last-week-in-collapse), or sent to your email inbox.\n\nOn Sunday, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan [lost a No Confidence vote](https://indianexpress.com/photos/world-news/pakistan-imran-khan-no-confidence-vote-protest-celebrations-7862781/) and was ousted from his position. Tens of thousands of [people spontaneously protested](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/4/11/photos-imran-khan-supporters-protest-pakistan-cities) for Khan’s return, although the situation seems lost. The new Prime Minister [is already boxed in](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/4/16/the-troubled-path-ahead-for-pakistans-new-prime-minister) by the situation; elections are scheduled for 2023.\n\n[Some outlets](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/09/business/food-fuel-prices-political-instability/index.html) blame rising inflation and food prices for the unrest in Pakistan—and elsewhere, as in [Peru](https://www.jurist.org/news/2022/04/peru-dispatch-food-and-fuel-protests-highlight-dissatisfaction-with-castillo-regime/) and in [Sri Lanka](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61028138)—and we may just be seeing the first wave of [food scarcity unrest](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/charting-global-economy-soaring-food-costs-risk-destabilization). **Modern society is predicated on cheap energy,** whether that’s petrol needed to drive our cars and make our plastics, LNG needed to heat our homes and generate electricity, or the calories needed to move the human body. **Peak Oil may be behind us, but what if Peak Food is, too?**\n\nSynthetic fertilizers, which depend on oil, are also increasing in price. People [fear the rising prices](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/uk-farmers-fear-fertiliser-fuel-feed-prices) in animal feed, fuel, and [fertilizer,](https://modernfarmer.com/2022/04/manure-supplies-global-fertilizer-crisis/) and what it means for their bottom line. There’s even a [poop shortage](https://www.drovers.com/news/beef-production/us-manure-hot-commodity-amid-commercial-fertilizer-shortage) now. Aw, shit.\n\nAll around the world, [in Palestine](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/fears-wheat-stocks-could-run-out-occupied-palestinian), in [China](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3173797/china-inflation-cost-food-rises-factory-gate-prices), in [Tunisia and Morocco](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-food-costs-push-arab-040004921.html), in [Brazil](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brazil-consumer-prices-jump-as-food-fuel-cost-more-271649420106), prices are going up as shortages loom and inflation is employed to remedy national debt and trading crises…and we are only in the second month of this new Ukraine invasion. Sri Lanka [is defaulting on its debt](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sri-lanka-temporarily-suspend-foreign-debt-payments-c-bank-governor-2022-04-12/), and at the same time that [Russia is “selectively” defaulting on its debt](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/12/1092077016/russia-historic-debt-default-sanctions-invasion-ukraine). \n\nThe American CPI—a measurement of the average price inflation for a collection of goods & services— [hit **8.5%**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-highest-40-years/) for the 12-month period from March 2021-2022. This is the first time in 40+ years that inflation & price increases have been this severe. It’s not just the Global South that’s suffering from decreasing purchasing power.\n\nThe avian flu spreading across the U.S. [has been detected in 25 states](https://www.abc57.com/news/how-the-increasing-number-of-bird-flu-cases-is-impacting-local-farms-poultry-and-egg-prices). You can track the outbreaks from American farms [here](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022); most affected birds were chickens and turkeys, but there are wild cases, including [bald eagles](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092907070/bald-eagles-bird-flu-sick-georgia) getting the bird flu.\n\nIn global COVID news, up to ⅔rds of Africans [have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2](https://www.afro.who.int/news/over-two-thirds-africans-exposed-virus-which-causes-covid-19-who-study) (which causes COVID-19). Only **16% of Africa has been fully vaccinated** so far. [The disease is now fully endemic and the population is not herd immune](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/12/herd-immunity-covid-reinfection-virus-world), —although the [WHO disagrees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/14/coronavirus-far-from-becoming-endemic-says-who) that COVID is already endemic— if herd immunity was ever even possible in the first place. Lockdowns in China’s northeastern provinces [have delayed the grain planting season](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-china-farming-idINL3N2WA256), which may result on lower crop yields by harvest time, adding more hunger problems to [China’s food fears](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/09/when-china-worries-about-food-the-world-pays)—affecting everyone else. Shanghai has been in a state of lockdown since March 28. Whatever restrictions are left in South Korea [are being lifted](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-lift-most-covid-curbs-next-week-yonhap-2022-04-14/) as cases drop from their record cases in March; the government is now [considering COVID to be a second-class disease](https://www.ft.com/content/4be21b01-efd3-4f67-b353-7bad9eb33607) like tuberculosis and cholera.\n\nIn U.S. COVID news, >![Philadelphia has reinstated the indoor mask mandate](https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-philadelphia-d7f5dacf0ae4ac004e5b15dd58362360) amid rising cases. Philadelphia (pop: 1.6M) is the 6th most populous city in the United States. COVID cases [continue to rise](https://www.axios.com/us-covid-cases-on-the-rise-again-9af7cdb7-25b1-4b59-9896-3c0f749a179d.html), especially in the Northeast U.S.!<\n\nA [terrible storm in Durban](​​https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61092334), South Africa, resulted in the deaths of more than 250 people, dropping months of rain in a single day. Meanwhile, in the United States, a [historic megadrought season](https://usbr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/81aaec3e74024ce6b9a5e50caa20984e) is depleting reservoirs across the West. Meanwhile, [Somalia’s terrible drought](https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/hundreds-thousands-could-die-somalia-without-urgent-humanitarian-intervention-warns) may result in the [deaths of 350,000 people](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61036465) by this summer, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nIn the Ukraine War, [Russian forces are gaining ground in Mariupol](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220411-live-zelensky-says-russian-forces-are-moving-to-larger-operations-in-ukraine-s-east); the coastal city may fall within weeks—but what will a Russian occupation of the ruins look like? [More than 90%](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-to-send-800-million-in-military-hardware-to-ukraine-885r9f68q) of buildings in the city were damaged or destroyed—4 weeks ago! The Mariupol mayor [said 10,000+ Ukrainians were killed in the siege of the city](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-war-mariupol-escape/31801917.html), and that mobile crematoria were brought in by Russia to destroy the bodies. There are supposedly about 120,000 people in the city now—a little over one quarter of the city’s prewar population. On Wednesday, [1,000+ Ukrainian marines surrendered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/more-than-1000-ukraine-marines-have-surrendered-in-mariupol-says-russia) to Russia—what will happen to them now?\n\nGlobal refugee flows are just getting started. Poland has already taken in [more than 2.5M Ukrainians](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/europe/2022/04/08/poland-could-absorb-a-million-more-refugees-from-ukraine/), but not all countries are so eager. The UN says [more than 5 million people have left Ukraine](https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-5-million-have-fled-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says/) in the last 7 weeks. The UK [is reportedly making a pact with Rwanda](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61097114) wherein (non-Ukrainian) refugee applicants will be flown 4000+ miles (6000+ km) to Rwanda to wait and have their asylum claims considered. “Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not,” said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mhmm. Meanwhile, OCHA also [claimed that](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1116212) on average, 30,000 Ukrainian refugees were going *back to* Ukraine every day.\n\nThe Russian cruiser Moskva [was sunk in the Black Sea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61114843) on Wednesday, struck by a Ukrainian-launched missile. Russians [vowed to escalate attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61117056) on Kyiv in the coming weeks. Biden and Trump [both called this War a “genocide”](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/3267118-trump-joins-biden-in-calling-russias-war-on-ukraine-genocide/) last week, a rhetorical, psychological, and legal escalation.\n\nSweden and Finland [could be joining NATO](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61093302) really soon, and [Russia has threatened](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/russia-threatens-new-nuclear-deployments-if-sweden-finland-join-nato.html) positioning nuclear weapons in the Baltic as a countermove. Nevertheless, I believe both countries will join NATO this year.\n\nA [skirmish in Jerusalem](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-61105497) broke out between Israelis and Palestinians, right before Passover and during Ramadan, allthewhile Israel’s ruling coalition [weakens—and may dissolve within months](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/04/israels-governing-coalition-increasingly-unstable) adding tension at an already tense time. \n\nA small energy face-off is developing off the coast of Kuwait. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia recently [agreed to work together to extract natural gas](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2062331/business-economy) from an offshore gas deposit, but Iran is claiming to have rights to the site, and also vows to drill for the gas. >!The Arash gas field is supposedly capable of producing 1 Billion cubic feet (28 Million cubic meters) of natural gas *per day*. At today’s price, that’s more than $6M USD of gas per day.) Saudi Arabia current extracts about [11B cubic feet of natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51018) per day.!< Energy geopolitics in action. Our civilization is addicted to cheap energy.\n\nNorth Korean totalitarian Kim Jong-Un [celebrated 10 years in power](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-celebrates-10-years-kim-jong-un-top-party-leader-2022-04-11/) this week.\n\nSome companies in Europe [will be devastated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas) when Russian natural gas stops flowing into Germany. Optimists claim Germany can become LNG-independent from Russia within 2 years; others day it’ll take at least 8 years. Coal plants will probably continue for a few more years as a stopgap measure. When a complex, fragile, interconnected world begins to break down from logistics failures, is that not a Collapse?\n\nThe [UN clarified a poorly-worded sentence](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61110406) >!—“Global greenhouse gases are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest by 2025”—!< in the IPCC Report, a line which I happened to mention in last week’s edition.\n\nSelect comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:\n\n-A Sri Lankan redditor [writes about the turbulence & protests](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/u145h4/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/i4nrin8/) and their general observations across a country in quick collapse. In this comment, several older comments are linked.\n\n-GHG emissions have expanded so much that we now have [more than 420 ppm of CO2](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/monthly.html) in the air. Redditor u/Myth_of_Progress [explains the downstream consequences](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/u4ao87/420_blaze_it_indepth/i4ud79o/), including wildfires and wildlife collapse.\n\n-The Ukraine War may be heading to a bad, bad place, according to [this analysis](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/u0tkpr/checkpoint_passed_things_are_reaching_a_new_level/) by a frequent r/collapse poster. Lots of great comments in this thread, too.\n\n-Redditors [react to the announcement](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/u2kqzb/white_house_eyes_water_security_strategy_as/) of America’s first “Water Security Strategy”...in 2022. What took you so long?\n\n-Speaking of water, [“rain bombs”](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/u1lj7w/the_now_disturbed_jet_stream_is_causing_a_new/) are becoming more common, as seen recently in Australia, South Africa, and elsewhere. \n\n\nDid you like this Collapse Report?

Where else could this be happening, but in a collapsing society.\n\nPeople pushed to the point where they are too tired to care... So they drop out of the social contract...\n\nI wonder if every other sign of collapse will just be pushed to the subconscious and \"accepted\" (except for those which the MSM tell people to be outraged against).\n\nAn entire generation of people effectively contracted into slavery?

Imran Khan claims he was the victim of a conspiracy to force him from office, and he vows to return to power after the 2023 elections. Thousands of people rallied to his cause in nationwide protests, and [some are saying](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/pakistan-inches-away-from-civil-unrest-after-ousting-of-imran-khan) that, by riling up the public behind him, he is playing with forces he cannot control, which threaten to destabilize Pakistan.\n\nThere is some good & bad news out of Mexico. A contentious energy bill [failed to become law](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-61139128) last week, which would have empowered energy companies at environmental expense. Yet, the bill had popular support; the Presidente called the vote “treasonous.” Also, [more than half of Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/drought-conditions-more-than-half-country/) is currently experiencing drought.

        "selftext": "I was reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ub44fc/a_world_thats_more_expensive_is_starting_to/) about inflation, and I noticed that many remarked about how the wealthy  corporate leaders don't seem to realize that the consumers of their products are getting so financially squeezed that they (we) are nearing the point where we can no longer afford to purchase their products. I contend that this is not a mistake, but by design.\n\nSome of you may recall [an article](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1) that came out about an expert who was called upon by a wealthy (all male) group of \"the elite\" to discuss the impending collapse, and how they might handle it. It tells us that the wealthy are certainly collapse-aware.\n\nI posit that the disenfranchisement of all of us, is being done deliberately. I do not believe that us being forced into poverty is some accident, or that the wealthy are blinded by their pursuit of wealth and forgetting that we need to eat. I believe they are doing this to us; that they are killing us intentionally.\n\nMy theory is that the wealthy see the impending collapse coming, and realize that they need extensive wealth to have hope of comfortably surviving it. They need their climate-controlled bunkers with crop fields and access to water. They need money to pay scientists and technologists to study how to stave off the worst effects of the collapse. They need to hoard food and resources and do anything to ensure their families' survival.\n\nWhat they are doing is a strategic transfer of wealth from us to them at a feverish pace *because* they know the collapse is coming soon. There is no time to make sure we are fed because there could be a heat wave that kills their prized stallions or a flood that damages their mansions/castles, or a violent uprising any day now. They need money, as much money as possible, fast. We are an obstacle to that, or for some who continue to live in denial, the useful idiot all too happy to hand over our hard-earned dollars to them and claim that they made their money fair and square because capitalism is god. \n\nThey don't care who lives or dies; some may even see our deaths as an objective because that means there are fewer of us with whom they must compete for resources. I believe we will start to see this attitude in legislation that harms the poor at an escalating pace. Look at the recent laws criminalizing homelessness; for example, Tennessee is not only banning camping basically everywhere, but they are [criminalizing it](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/18/tennessee-bill-penalizing-homelessness-passes-legislature-after-debate-citing-hitler/7287979001/). That's only one example of these laws punishing us for being robbed.\n\nOf course, once the collapse happens, the wealthy will also need a select few of us to guard their hoard. From the article:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could be developed in time. \n\nThey want to **put collars on us**. They want to continue their campaign of terror against us *after the collapse*. Understand that. And when the author suggested just treating their guards like human beings, they were \"amused\" but thought that was impossible.\n\nI know that there are differing opinions on whether there is truly a single elite functioning together in a campaign against the rest of us, and that's up for debate. But I believe that some of the wealthy definitely have a strategy in mind which they deploy on us day after day. At any time, they could treat us like humans, but that thought doesn't even cross their minds because it is adverse to their goals. Harm to us is an inherent part of the mission.\n\nIronically, the way they are treating us makes it that much more likely that some kind of civil war will begin in this powder keg given how much harm is being done to people physically and mentally.\n\nDo not let them put a literal collar on you.",

        "selftext": "Steven Donziger sued Chevron for contaminating the Amazon and won. Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18,000,000,000. Yesterday, Donziger went to prison, in the what’s being called the first-ever case of corporate prosecution. \n\nOver three decades of drilling in the Amazon, Chevron deliberately dumped more than 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater and 17 million gallons of crude oil into the rainforest. Chevron committed ecocide to save money—about $3 per barrel. Many experts consider it the biggest oil-related disaster in history, with the total area affected 30 times larger than the Exxon-Valdez spill. Chevron created a super-fund site in the Amazon rainforest that is estimated to be the size of Rhode Island. \n\nSteven Donziger visited Ecuador in 1993, where he says he saw \"what honestly looked like an apocalyptic disaster,\" including children walking barefoot down oil-covered roads and jungle lakes filled with oil. Industrial contamination caused local tribes to suffer from mouth, stomach, and uterine cancers, respiratory illnesses, along with birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages.\n\nAs an attorney, Donziger represented over 30,000 farmers and indigenous Ecuadorians in a case against Chevron and *won*. In 2011, Chevron was found guilty and ordered to pay $18 billion. Rather than accept this decision, the company vowed to fight the judgment \"until Hell freezes over, and then fight it out on the ice.\" Chevron has been persecuting Steven Donziger for his involvement ever since. In an internal memo, Chevron wrote, “Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger.” \n\nChevron sued Donziger for 60 billion dollars, which is *the most any individual has ever been sued for in American legal history*. Over the course of ten years, armed with a legal team numbering in the thousands, the company set out to destroy Donziger. Chevron had Donziger disbarred, froze his bank accounts, slapped him with millions in fines without allowing him a jury, forced him to wear a 24h ankle monitor, imposed a lien on his home where he lives with his family, and shut down his ability to earn a living. Donziger has been under house arrest since August 2019.\n\nChevron has used its clout and advertising dollars to keep the story from being reported. “I’ve experienced this multiple times with media,” Donziger said. “An entity will start writing the story, spend a lot of time on it, then the story doesn’t run.” This unprecedented legal situation is happening in New York City, the hometown of the New York Times—but the paper has yet to report on the full story.\n\nOn October 27, 2021, Donziger entered federal prison for a six-month sentence. He had already spent over 800 days in house arrest, which is *four times longer than the maximum sentence allowed for this charge.* Anyone who cares about the rule of law should be appalled. It is an absolute embarrassment, to our government and to our constitution, that Steven Donziger is imprisoned on US soil.\n\nAs the title states, Chevron is in the process of executing the first-ever corporate prosecution in American history. This case sets a terrible precedent for attorneys and activists seeking to hold oil companies liable for pollution. Chevron is pursuing this case—to the benefit of the entire fossil fuel industry—to dissuade future litigation that may call them to account for their role in climate change.\n\n[Lawyer Steven Donziger, Who Sued Chevron over “Amazon Chernobyl,” Ordered to Prison After House Arrest](https://www.democracynow.org/2021/10/27/steven_donziger_judicial_harassment_from_chevron)\n\n[This Lawyer Went After Chevron. Now He’s 600 Days Into House Arrest.](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/03/lawyer-steven-donziger-went-after-chevron-now-600-days-house-arrest/)\n\nEDIT 1: Chevron went after him with a civil RICO lawsuit (accusing him of racketeering). Their argument is that Donziger is a fraud who just wanted to extort them for big bucks. They’ve been working hard to paint him as such in the media. Chevron sued him for $60B but then dropped the damages just weeks before because they realized it would necessitate a jury. [Judge Lewis A Kaplan](https://nlginternational.org/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mirer-Kaplan-Complaint-Appendix.pdf), who had undisclosed investments in Chevron, ordered Donziger to turn over his computer to Chevron’s attorneys (with decades of client communications). Donziger argued this violated attorney-client privilege. He refused to comply so the judge charged him with contempt. US attorneys declined to pursue the charge so Judge Kaplan made the exceedingly rare move to appoint private law firm Seward and Kissel, who had Chevron as a *major* client, to prosecute him “in the name of” the US govt. Kaplan also appointed Judge Preska as presiding judge. She is the leader of the right-wing Federalist Society of which Chevron is a major “gold circle” donor. I also just learned that the handpicked prosecutor, Rita Glavin, who has financial ties to oil, has billed taxpayers nearly half a million dollars to prosecute Donziger. That’s apparently 150x higher than the norm for a misdemeanor. So many conflicts of interest. So many aspects that are simply unprecedented. \n\nEDIT 2: Chevron wants this to go away quietly. They have done their best to suffocate this story. **Chevron does not want us to draw attention to the ecocide they deliberately committed (and were literally found guilty of!) in the Amazon.** We can foil their plans by signing the MoveOn petition below and making sure this story gets shared widely.\n\nEDIT 3: You can also follow him on Twitter. His handle is [@SDonziger](https://twitter.com/sdonziger?s=21). \n\nEDIT 4: I know we are all rightfully pissed off but please refrain from advocating violence in the comments. I’m grateful to the mods for keeping this posted here. Let’s not make things difficult on them. \n\nEDIT 5: Ok this petition had around 1k signatures on it this afternoon… and now it’s almost at 7k!!! Let’s get it over 10k because we can.\n\nEDIT 6: Umm holy shit…\n##We made Chevron trend on Reddit. \n\nThe mods also just let me know that this is the top post of all time on this subreddit and the first to get over 10k upvotes. \n\nThanks to everyone who was able to share this story far and wide.\n\nEDIT 7: I also want to add here that [this report](https://chevronsglobaldestruction.com/chevrons_global_destruction_report.pdf) was released today showing that there are 70 ongoing cases in 31 countries against Chevron, and only 0.006% ($286-million) in fines, court judgements, and settlements have been paid. The company still owes another $50,500,000,000 in total globally.\n\nEDIT 8: Many have asked if they can send words of support. For those still interested, you may send a letter to: Steven Donziger\nRegister No: 87103-054, Federal Correctional Institution Pembroke Station in Danbury, CT 06811. \n\nEDIT 9: Another person who deserves to be infamous is Randy Mastro, partner at Gibson Dunn Crutcher, who represented Chevron throughout this debacle: \n\n“Partners at Gibson Dunn appeared to regard the firm’s work for Chevron on the RICO matter as a major profit center. The firm reportedly received **more than $1 billion in legal fees** from Chevron over a period of approximately five years after an intensive marketing campaign where it fashioned itself as a “rescue squad” for corporations in legal trouble. The Chevron RICO case and its related litigations, according to various sources, reportedly have **generated the largest fee in the history of Gibson Dunn which was founded in 1890.** Gibson Dunn and litigation partner Mastro -- who personally negotiated the payments to Ecuadorian judge Alberto Guerra -- were under enormous pressure to deliver Chevron “evidence” of fraud at virtually any cost given prior promises to its leading client that it would execute what the firm called the “kill step” against human rights litigation from foreign plaintiffs.”\n\n\n**SIGN THE PETITION! (U.S. only)**\n\n[MoveOn Petition: Free Steven Donziger ](https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/free-steven-donziger?source=rawlink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=rawlink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;share=6bf7358e-6264-4bc0-99c3-ef740e3fb6ce) \n\nIf you want to learn more about this incident check out [Chevron Toxico](https://chevrontoxico.com/) and watch the documentary [CRUDE](https://youtu.be/BvrZRvgwBS8) which can be streamed for free on YouTube.\n\nIf you have time, please read the [wiki on SLAPP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation) which is short for strategic lawsuit against public participation. It is a maneuver used “to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.”",

        "selftext": "I’ve been in my car for 26 hours now, the majority of that spent at a standstill on I-95 caused by yesterday’s snowstorm.\n\nI had no signal until just now, GPS stopped working and I couldn’t contact anyone or look up what was going on. I imagine this was because of too many phones pinging off of too few towers in the affected areas.\n\nLocal radio is actually corporate radio, and except for the repeated promos (“you’re listening to the rock of Fredericksburg” type BS) so there was no news or information on the radio either.\n\nI ran out of food and water by the end, but fortunately had stuff with me.\n\nI saw people going to the bathroom between their car doors and carrying containers for gas or water to the nearest exit over two miles away.\n\nThere were abandoned vehicles and trucks and more and more people started taking the shoulder, blocking its use for emergency vehicles when they got stuck themselves.\n\nI saw no emergency or response vehicles until after 10AM today, 15 hours after traffic stopped for me.\n\nI’m grateful that my gas tank was full.\n\nThis has been infuriating and shameful. Infuriating because this is the consequence of building our lives and cities around the personal automobile. Shameful because this response is just pitiful - snow should be no surprise, accidents should be no surprise. I can’t for the life of me figure out how two hours outside the Nations capitol things are this bad. \n\nI’ve lived in southern Germany where it snows like this regularly and the highways are just fine. How are we this incapable?\n\nGetting a glimpse of just how quickly things can go off the rails has certainly galvanized me. America is broken, shamefully, pitifully broken, and when the signal goes on your phone, the calculus changes.\n\n**UPDATE: I made it home.**\n\nFirst off I wanted to say why I was on the road - I had to be for work. I delayed returning to the DC area by a full day to try to avoid this exact storm, but couldnt delay any further. Now, the facility I work at is closed possibly until the 7th. That wasn't the case at the time though - so I had to head back.\n\nIt was around 10AM when I saw the first cop, a full 15 hours after traffic stopped. They blocked off 95 and ushered all traffic onto an exit ramp and US-1, which subsequently became it's own parking lot. I only got out of that traffic by heading west on backroads, past entirely dark neighborhoods and dozens of ditched cars and looping my way back to my own neighborhood. 95 and US-1 were complete gridlock still when I arrived home 25 hours after traffic stopped.\n\nIt took me three stops after leaving the highway to find gas, and when I stopped at a Publix for food, I was shocked to find the place trashed, nearly stripped bare and closing at 5PM. There wasnt even any toilet paper in the bathroom.\n\nI never regained signal (T-Mobile) while around US-1 or 95, which made the whole thing so much more frustrating because I couldnt contact anyone or see what my options were traffic wise.\n\nTraffic updates did come onto the radio by midday - but all they said was \"avoid the interstate\" and then they started referring to US-1 as a parking lot as if there were any other option or as if the police hadnt directed traffic that way.\n\nAnyway I'm exhausted and pissed that this entire fiasco occurred. We need investments in mass transit/rail/walkable cities *yesterday*.",

        "selftext": "I’m so mad right now. I have so much loathing for the US. This country is nothing but a shopping mall. There are no commons. Everything that should exist for the benefit of all is either sold off to private hands, or massively defunded until it’s effectively worthless. Prisons are some of our largest employers in several states. All the life of an American is is to work and shop. And if you cant shop, get out of the way, fill a prison bed.\n\nThe police are the glue that holds it all together. They move the “loitering” homeless along. They evict the family that can’t make rent. They enforce the pipeline easement. They enforce the deed of the developer who pushes poor residents out of their generational home. They bust the kid who sells pot. They bust the woman who sells her body to get by.\n\nIt’s never, ever spoken about that capitalism REQUIRES an underclass. It REQUIRES unemployment. And by doing so it forces the poorest among us to find black market trades to survive. It forces low income workers to find a hustle to get by. And then the police are stationed en masse in the poorest places to attack and jail those people, all to fill a prison bed so a slurry of private corporations that are all traded on wall street, whose three capital letters fill 401ks and pension funds, can make quarterly growth projections.\n\nThis isn’t a society. It isn’t a nation. It is a fucking shopping mall, and the products are all made with violence, the storefronts exist by violence, and it is all in service of making the rich richer.  And if ever, ever, people try to rise up against this absolute garbage state of affairs, the state comes down heavy with violence.\n\nThe poor cannot get at the rich. They are in their penthouses and gated mansions. The poor cannot loot a stock portfolio. The best they can manage, in their bravest moment, is to smash a window and steal some jeans, or an apple watch. And then its cries from the ignorant masses of, “How dare they! How dare they violate the sanctity of the shopping mall!” In a country with the greatest wealth disparity the world has ever known, where children go to sleep hungry, where healthcare bankrupts people of their life savings on a daily basis, in a country where the schools that aren’t de facto prisons are crumbling, in a country where the water is poisoned and everyone knows it and fixing it would be cheap but instead we have emerald mine heirs launching cars into outer space for giggles, people weep for the shattered glass and the stolen t.v.\n\nCorporations get handed fifty billion dollar checks of taxpayer money - corporations that could easily have issued more stock if they needed cash, but whose CEO’s refused to dilute their own wealth - and that’s not considered looting. No one bats an eye. Good for them, give the owners another bonus. But poor and middle class people take some shit that maybe they need, or maybe they need to sell, and a cheer goes up when it’s suggested they should be shot on sight.\n\nBlack people and the natives of this continent have gotten it the worst.  They get fucked, and then they get fucked again, and then they get fucked again, AND WE ALL KNOW IT!  Our only options are to know it and do nothing, maybe pay it some lip service, or to like it, to revel in it, to cash in on their suffering.  And in this moral, Christian nation, so many people choose the latter.  Every day a new hashtag, a new name added to the list.  A black person killed by a cop who has the golden shield of the words, “I feared for my life,” - a shield no civilian is ever allowed to use themselves - or an indigenous woman abducted and raped by some white oilfield workers whose name never makes the national news.\n\nThis isn’t a country, it’s a colony.  It’s a robbery in progress.  It’s the mass looting of the wealth of the globe all so a few thousand people can guarantee that their great, great, great grandchildren can live in opulence without ever lifting a finger.  \n\nThere will be no peace without resolution. There can only be submission.  We are animals on a farm to them.  Allowed to roam the pastures a bit, but ultimately, everything we do must be in the service and interest of the farmers.  Line up at the trough, pull your plough, but never, ever try to stamp down the fences.  \n\nToothless reforms will fix nothing because those in power will refuse to go to the root, they will refuse to upend capitalism.  Beating people into submission with the military and with malicious cops will not make the anger and the hopelessness go away. All it can do is force it back underground, where it will wait to explode in another place, at another time. But people cannot unsee what they have seen. The raw aggression from the police against the public cannot be unseen, unheard, unfelt. It can only spread. And this goes for the racism, and the pearl clutching, and the bootlicking of cowards of all stripes. You are seen.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much.  I didn’t expect this to be so popular.  I have never had this many responses to a reddit post before.  I’m out cutting trees for a friend, and I’m so angry and anxious I am worried about operating my chainsaw properly.\n\nAnyway, solidarity to all of my fellow denizens out there.  Together we’re strong.  We keep us safe.\n\nEdit 2: OK, I didn't kill myself with a chainsaw or falling tree.  So, I am posting a link here to a book that everyone should read.  It’s called “How Nonviolence Protects the State.” It takes apart all the myths and cliches surrounding non-violent protests.  It’s very good. Very thorough.\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-how-nonviolence-protects-the-state",

The replacement part was on national backorder. You see, truck parts aren't really made in the US. They're imported from Canada and Mexico. Due to the borders issues associated with covid, nobody can get the parts in.\n\nThe wait time on the part was so long that my company elected to simply buy a new truck for me rather than wait.\n\nTwo days later, the new truck broke down. The part they needed to fix it? On national backorder. I'll have to wait weeks for a fix. There are 7 other drivers at this same shop facing the same issue. We're all carrying loads that are now late.\n\nSo next time you're wondering why the goods you're waiting for aren't on the shelves, keep in mind that THIS is a big part of it.",

Overwhelming as in there are 1-5 *highly conditional* yes votes in the top 400 comments of the stickied thread, 1-5 outright yes votes, and *every single other vote is no*. The answer is **no**.\n\nI see the mod(s) in support of this change saying they are willing to take on a higher workload to make this transition successful. This belies a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens when a subreddit blows up. You will not have a higher workload, you will have an *impossible* workload. This is not an indictment of your prowess as moderators. This is a fact that this change invites an inevitable demographic shift that will make maintaining the relative integrity of this sub literally impossible.\n\nAs it stands, a single motivated person can comb through the logs and figure out whatever they need to figure out for themselves. The mods can watch us and we can watch them. There is a range of what collapse means here, but it is also surprisingly specific, and I believe accurate. There is harmony in that we can learn about and experience and resist collapse in our own way in an organically growing community, a community that displays shocking dialectical honesty and integrity, a community that isn't overwhelmed at all times by an ulterior agenda seeking to subvert our community to its purpose.\n\nThis is worth preserving.\n\nIf you want to moderate a larger community of mostly transient posters, please do. Go find one and become a mod there. Do not transform this one against its wishes. The collapsniks spoke, please listen.",

        "selftext": "I'm panicking. I think those of us in the US right now are experiencing the last four years of relative \"normal\" us Americans are going to enjoy, because I think after 2024, shit is going to hit the fan.\n\nI'm a political science major. One thing I studied while I was at university is a concept known as democratic backsliding - the phenomenon in which institutions within a democracy degrade over time until at a certain point, you're not really a democracy anymore. I recognize this occurring in the United States...especially after January 6th. You can make arguments that this has already happened to a certain degree in the US but...I think the finalizing moment is going to come during the 2024 election.\n\nHere are the facts that are leading me to hypothesize this conclusion:\n\n[1.) Former President Donald Trump tried to halt the peaceful transfer of power after his electoral loss in 2020.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election)\n\n[2.) He justified such actions based on the outright falsehood that the election was unfair, despite lacking any evidence whatsoever.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_reactions_to_Donald_Trump%27s_claims_of_2020_election_fraud)\n\n[3.) This culminated in an overt coup attempt by his supporters, which he did not reject until it became obvious no one else supported it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack)\n\n[4.) Trump still has not conceded.](https://www.yahoo.com/now/trump-says-not-conceded-november-210600776.html)\n\n[5.) Despite lacking evidence, a majority of Republicans believe Trump's loss was due to the \"Voter Fraud Conspiracy\".](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/28/a-majority-of-republicans-believe-the-2020-election-was-stolen/)\n\n[6.) Trump remains the favorite to run for the republican party again in 2024.](https://www.deseret.com/2021/4/4/22320128/early-guide-to-the-2024-republican-primary-trump-pence-desantis-pompeo-romney-haley-noem-cruz-hawley)\n\n[7.) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL - Republicans that doubt/challenge allegations of voter fraud are being ousted from the Republican party by the base.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/06/18/traitor-mike-pence-booed-in-florida-while-addressing-christian-crowd/)\n\nTL;DR: A former president believes he was removed from power illegitimately based on a conspiracy theory, and now the entirety of the Republican Party Apparatus has adjusted to reflect support of this viewpoint, and subsequent attempts to \"correct\" the mistake by overturning democracy.\n\nThere is no \"Republican Party\" anymore.\n\nThere is the Trump Party, and the Neoliberal Status Quo party. The Republican base no longer believes in democracy, and they will now act accordingly based on this belief. Right now, Joe Biden is at the helm by a thin 1 vote margin in the Senate. It is very likely that he will lose this majority in 2022.\n\nThis means that if Trump runs again in 2024, loses to Joe again, but has a majority of republicans controlling Congress...**THEY WILL VOTE TO REJECT JOE BIDEN'S WIN, AND INSTALL TRUMP INTO POWER VIA REJECTING ELECTORAL VOTES.**\n\nAND BEFORE YOU CALL ME CRAZY\n\n***THEY ARE ALREADY DEMONSTRATING THEY WILL DO THIS BASED ON WHAT THEY SAY - WHO THEY ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE - AND WHO THEY ARE CALLING TRAITORS IN THEIR OWN PARTY.***\n\nHere's the real breakdown of how the different spectrum of politics is at the moment.\n\nNeolibs still think we can \"Go Back to Obama\".\n\nNeocons are dead as a relevant bloc.\n\nProgressives are busy nitpicking the Neolibs to actually work together to stop facism.\n\nTrumpets have gone full fascist. \n\nWe're honestly fucked and IDK what to do but I'm making my plans now.",

It still took me six months to find a place to live. I have a breed restricted dog and it's incredibly hard to find a place that will allow her that's anywhere near my price range. I was literally looking in six different states in the Western US. I finally found a place in Washington state. It's a dumpster of a house in a god-awful neighborhood, with a cartoonishly terrible landlord. Rent is over $1,000 and that's bafflingly cheap, even for this shit hole.\n\nI hate everything about it here. I hate living in a country that doesn't get a single thing right. There's not one thing about America that I feel is good enough to take pride in. When I see an American flag I assume it's a racist asshole. \n\nI studied climate science in my master's program. I hate knowing that if there was ever any chance to effectively address climate change America was the country that could have done it. We had the most knowledge on the subject and we were in the best position to influence a massive shift in global economic practices. We might have saved the world. Instead we paved the way for a future that will probably look a lot like the movie The Road or Children of Men.

        "selftext": "Until tonight, I really didn’t understand the gravity of what’s going on around us. I went to the ER because I’ve been having terrible stomach pains with bloody stools and I wasn’t ready for what I saw there. \n\nWhen they say that the hospitals are running out of beds, they truly mean it. I sat in the waiting room for over six hours, next to patients with broken, bleeding limbs and elderly folks gasping for air, all pleading for a bed, only to be told over and over that they just had to wait. \n\nI kept my hands in my pockets and used hand sanitizer every time I touched anything, but the air was heavy and oppressive, filled with fear and frustration. I watched a man be wheeled in from an ambulance, only to die feet away from me as the EMTs struggled to perform CPR. He was only in his late 30s, barely older than me.\n\nAfter my time waiting, I was sent home with prescriptions to help fix what turns out to be a stomach infection and intestinal bleeding. The first pharmacy I went to informed me that the earliest I could get my medications would be on Friday — three more days of excruciating gut pains and bloody shits. So I went to another, farther away, only to be told that it would take until at least tomorrow night.\n\nThey told me to call a pharmacy outside of the city, and I was told I’d be able to get my prescriptions tonight, so I drove 30 minutes and I’m now sitting in my car for the 1.5 hour wait.\n\nI can’t escape the image of that man dying in the waiting room. The collapse isn’t a mushroom cloud and instantaneous obliteration. No, the collapse is an old woman gasping and gurgling, begging for a bed that never comes. \n\nIf this is the scene playing out in hospitals and pharmacies across the country and across the globe, I am terrified as to what the coming weeks hold. Please stay safe, y’all.\n\nEdit 1: this took place in Las Vegas, NV. I’m vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer and I’ve been wearing a mask whenever out of my home around other people since March 2020. It’s crazy how many assumptions people can make.\n\nEdit 2: I’m not going to read or respond to any more comments. I’m barely processing this shit and being accused of lying about one of the worst evenings I’ve had is incredibly hurtful. I wish I were lying, but I’m not. I wish that man didn’t die in front of me, but he did. I wish those old folks had beds to lay in, but they didn’t. Some people are so convinced that they know the truth that they’re willing to harass people who have had different experiences. I’m done.",

But people fail to recognize that complex civilizations have completely collapsed. Lately I have been studying the Sumerians and the Late Bronze Age Collapse.\n\n People do not realize how sophisticated the first civilizations were. People think of the Sumerians as a bunch of loincloth-clad savages burning babies. Until I started studying them, I had no clue as to the massiveness of the cities and temples they built. Or that they literally had \"beer gardens\" in the city where people would congregate around a \"keg\" of beer and drink it with straws. Or the complexity of their trade routes and craftsmanship of their jewelry. \n\nFrom my studies, it appears that the Late Bronze Age Collapse was caused by a variety of environmental, economic, and political factors: climate change causes long periods of draught; draught meant crop failure; crop failure meant people couldn't eat and revolted against their leaders; neighboring states went to war over scarce resources; the trade routes broke down; tin was no longer available to make bronze; and economic migrants (the sea peoples) tried to get a foothold on the remaining resource rich land--Egypt. \n\nAnd the result was not some mere setback, but the complete destruction and abandonment of every major city in the eastern Mediterranean; civilization (writing, pottery, organized society) disappeared for hundreds of years. \n\nIf it has happened before, it can happen again.",

        "selftext": "My mum was a free spirit; an artist; a dreamer. She was also a passionate advocate for those disenfranchised by society. The wayfarers, starving creatives, the punks, the hippies…the anything. Our door was always open. Come in, have a brew, have a smoke. Here’s a tenner. She never lived within the confines of society, and always did her own thing. Throughout the 90s she painted ultraviolet “backdrops” for raves and clubs around Britain. \n\nAfter the rave years ended she struggled with life. The belonging she felt within the scene dried up. Friends put on suits and ties. Friends died. \n\nFast forward a few years and she seemed lost and had started talking about end of days conspiracies. She was also fervently saying the social fabric of society was breaking down. Community was a thing of the past, she said. Her beliefs were messy, from rogue planets entering our solar system and causing an apocalypse to religious prophecies coming true. She also hated capitalism and claimed it was in its late stages. Essentially, she feared some kind of collapse. This spurred her to start prepping with freeze dried and tinned food. She spent almost 24 hours a day down online rabbit holes. \n\nThen one day she borrowed a van and disappeared. She turned up in Scotland (we live in the south of England). The police had picked her up in a state of psychosis. She was sectioned, diagnosed with schizophrenia, released and then she went missing again. This time it took weeks to find her. Turns out she was living homeless in Edinburgh. After refusing the police’s heavy handed “help” and threatening them with a weapon she was sectioned again, this time for months. \n\nEventually she was able to come home. She looked thin, tired, and was losing her hair. She no longer talked to me about apocalypse scenarios. The last time I saw her was in a pub by the ocean. We drank and I, with deep regret, moaned about my job. She kept offering me her house and what little money she had. I thought that was odd…\n\nA few days after, she hanged herself. Never have I felt such anguish. In the two years that have passed since, her mind has been a riddle to me, one which I’m now beginning to understand. We called you unwell mum, but you were more right than you knew. It might not be rogue planets, or religious dogma, but collapse is coming. \n\nAll I wish is that I could chat to you about it. No judgement. Just love. \n\nRIP beautiful lady.\n\nEdit: just to confirm. I’m okay. My mum was unwell, I know this. However, amongst her delusions she had some pertinent things to say about the state of the world. At the time I couldn’t listen and bundled it all together with her general mental illness.\n\nEdit 2: wow, this has blown up. I’m reading all of your comments and some have stopped me in my tracks. Such empathic, insightful people. Thank you for your support. I’m honestly okay though, just needed to vent. Also wanted to say, I’m here for anyone who wants to confide about similar experiences. Much love. \n\nIn answer to a couple of questions. Sectioning is being taken to psychiatric hospital. This happens when someone “poses a risk to themselves or others”. My mum was 49 when she died. \n\nFinally to the Redditor who commented about writing a book, and my writing style. I’m not offended. Thanks for the compliment. Funnily enough, I’m a writer, and my mum’s mad and wonderful life is ripe for the literary picking. Said as much in her eulogy. \n\nEdit 3: for anyone making judgements on my mum’s suicide, wind your necks in. She did it, it’s done. Her reasons were valid to her. \n\nEdit 4: Fuck me, some of the stories people are sharing are heartbreaking. So sorry to hear of your struggles and grief. I’m right there with you. We’ll make it. \n\nX",

This expert (🤡) literally compared the weather and said that climate change is not factor in generating wealth.\n* Politicians are not literate in science, they trust the experts, and the experts tell them that this is not a concern at all. No wonder they ignore so many activists, protests, and the like.

These people will almost never start topics, as they KNOW they will be taken down (applause to the moderators on this as well; you guys have done a top-notch job of keeping this under control!) BUUUUT, they are starting to infest the comments section.\n\nJust doing my morning scroll-through, I see numerous posters on the first thread trying to perpetuate flagrant misinformation on one of the legitimate COVID articles discussing how “Omicron is not mild.” \n\nI know this is a tricky subject to talk about. On the one hand it could be argued that it is just dialogue, and we don’t want to restrict discussion on a hot button issue. However, I have seen this gradual trickle into this sub as a result of its explosive growth last year. The best part of this sub has always been it’s commitment to sourced content and a required explanation for any shared content. It results in the integrity of the content being maintained in terms of facts, sources, and tone.\n\nI don’t think this should be compromised for the comments. We are holding our contributors to a high standard, and it is reflected in the quality levels of the content being shared; I would like that same standard to be held for users. Reading any thread and seeing an ignorant opinion floating around here and there is not the worst, but when you are seeing people promote flagrant misinformation from far-right rhetoric (“vaccines aren’t real”, or “it’s all a scam to make money off your natural immunity”) shouldn’t be tolerated. It is not only ignorant, it is genuinely disruptive.\n\nCan we please be more aggressive on banning the worst offenders when it comes to this subject?",

She said “I have no doubt that what you are saying is true, but I’m going to keep living my life the way I am anyways and if we all die, then we die.” It really surprised me at the time and I couldn’t understand this attitude. \n\nNow I realize that mental collapse has long since already happened, like decades ago. Most people are hanging on to their lives by a fucking thread. Video games, pornography, television, mindless consumption and social media are literally the only things that keep us going. We’re like drug addicts that decided to kill ourselves but figured doing Meth until we OD is more fun than just shooting ourselves. There is no life for the vast majority of people, there is only delayed suicide.\n\nSomewhere in there, I think people realize this. We can’t imagine society being any other way than it is. And no one will fight to protect this society because no one truly wants to live in it. We are just enjoying our technological treats while we can. Long since given up on any deeper meaning to our lives. And if we all die, then we die. People don’t care and deny collapse because they really and genuinely have no sense at all that their lives are important anymore.",

These hedge funds were basically established by extremely wealthy individuals with 500 million to \"invest\" - a friend of a family friend, sort of deal - typical 1% corrupt incestuous shit. I've rubbed elbows with this crowd - slimy, soulless and rotten to the bone.\n\nAnyways - I just wanted to say that not only did I find yesterday's 2% selloff, impressive (hedge funds desperately freed up liquidity in anticipation) . Also - I'm legitimately proud of our fellow wage slaves for not only exposing the scam to the world (the general public is now increasingly aware of the establishment).   -Many of these folks are outright altruistic. The billionaires would never be this altruistic. Jeff Bezos literally donated less than I did, on a % basis, and I donate $200 a month on my wage slave salary. If you go to [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) you can see posts of altruism, donations, etc etc. The incestuous, soulless billionaires donate to their own religious orders, and view the general public as consumer slaves. Their donations exist to merely balance their tax sheets, and fortify tax loopholes.\n\nThis clearly demonstrates that the mentally ill psychopathic soul-less billionaires who control the vast majority of the worlds fiat currency do not represent, in any way, the nature of the common human. No, we are a noble species, just ruled by sick psychopathic elites who were born with brain disorders.\n\nFuck the rich, they deserve to get eaten, and I hope they do.",

        "selftext": "As most of us on the subreddit know, everything from agriculture to supply chains to the climate is starting to collapse. The world governments have spent decades pledging to make changes, but our energy and material use has only accelerated. The IPCC will release greenwashed plans with BECCS, direct air carbon capture, and other unproven technologies. Journalists run with the story and a large part of the public gets lulled into techno-hopium. The climate movement has not worked and we need to shift strategies. \n\nHumanity is at a cross roads. We can either degrow our society through a planned deconstruction of polluting, non-essential industries and focus on building local resiliency. Or face a hard swift collapse of globalized society as crop failures grow in breadbasket regions and the water runs out. I would rather try to deconstruct our version of society than sit around and read more facts about how collapse is actually happening. We know what's happening and now it's time to take action.\n\nI think the most necessary step and barrier we have to cross is making the concept of collapse mainstream. As the subreddit has noticed, r/worldnews has been increasingly posting articles that you could see in r/collapse. Many people repost those articles to acknowledge what is happening; that collapse is already getting some mainstream traction. I think we can use the power of our 300,000 members to help advance the narrative in mainstream discourse. A band of redditors was able to use their collective strength to put pressure on financial firms, and I'm sure we can have a similar effect. \n\n[u/DocMoochal](https://www.reddit.com/user/DocMoochal/) cross-posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/onh7vs/is_the_canadian_dream_dead/) from r/Canada, about the collapse of the Canadian dream. The post has over 50 awards and 10k karma, putting it at the top of the subreddit. We can all go make similar posts on our nation/city/state's subreddit, talking about local collapse news, and bringing more attention to the subject. \n\nWhenever you see a post that is related to collapse on a different subreddit (climate change, housing markets, supply chains, etc.), make a comment to talk about how the topic is related to the overall subject of collapse. Any time you have the ability to connect dots, speak up. Go out of your way to talk about the climate crisis and especially local changes. Talk about difficulties you've experienced personally. Inject collapse into conversations on every subreddit; recently there was a post in r/engineering about the supply chain crisis that got a ton of traction. If there an article posted about your locale on r/collapse, cross post it to your local subreddit. Any time you have the chance, try to bring up collapse online or in real conversations.\n\nYou might occasionally get called a doomer (and who cares the world is ending), but you would be surprised how much traction you might get. That post about the Canadian dream being dead hit a chord with a bunch of other people. As more people get opened up to the idea of collapse, we can change the conversation from net-zero to degrowth and resiliency. I really don't think there is any way forward but to bring people up to speed on where the climate crisis already is. \n\nI think there are also a lot of steps we can take to start organizing this subreddit to take action together. It only takes a couple thousand of people to get a hashtag trending on twitter. If even a third of the subreddit participated, we could make a collapse hashtag go viral and force the conversation to happen. \n\nIf anyone has any more ideas on how to use the power of our large membership to start paving the way towards normalizing collapse and degrowth scenarios, I would love to have a conversation about it here or in a DM. I'll make sure to do my part on trying to normalize collapse and degrowth, and together we can start changing the status quo.",

Keep it cool. \n\n## tl;dr / summary\n\nThe Marshall Fire ~~currently burning~~ [now covered in snow](https://www.cpr.org/2022/01/01/boulder-county-fires-water-shut-off-in-superior-thousands-without-gas-and-electricity-in-freezing-temps/), known as \"the most destructive fire in Colorado history,\" is directly over the top of known plutonium contamination, generated by radioactive waste leaking from barrels, courtesy of the Rocky Flats Plant. This facility manufactured the bulk of the plutonium pits (nuclear weapons triggers) in the height of the Cold War. In the past, strong wind events were known to spread radioactive particulates from this site and activists -- including the very FBI agent who led the historic raid on the Rocky Flats Plant -- have been sounding the alarm on this inevitability for years. \n\nThis story is a breathtaking example of the truth being stranger than fiction. In a series of events from the 1950s all the way up to the present day, there have been a series of cover-ups by the U.S. Department of Energy, its subcontractors Dow and Rockwell, the Justice Department, and at least two generations of property development powerhouses.\n\nThe clean-up effort was originally projected to take 65 years and $37 billion to do properly, but after only 10 years and $7 billion (most of which went to administrators), the clean-up effort was heralded as a success and the superfund site was opened up for both property development and recreation.\n\nOne might argue the clean-up effort was half-assed or even deliberately negligent. For example only the top 3 feet of contaminated soil was cleaned up, even though contamination is known to be much deeper and natural processes routinely bring up soil from 16 feet and below. This is the case even when excluding criminal dumping and incineration of radioactive waste clandestinely undertaken by the plant. (As an aside, uncooperative employees were known to have been [deliberately exposed to \"infinity levels\" of radiation](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/the_most_destructive_fire_in_colorado_history/hqv1w7h/).) For nearly the last 20 years, there has been insufficient testing and monitoring of radioactive contamination in the area, which again is driven by commercial interests in the present day.\n\nIt is imperative that those in impacted areas, *especially* in the context of the Marshall fires are aware of the clear and present danger, namely Plutonium-239. This is an alpha emitter, meaning you can be harmed by breathing or ingesting particulates. \n\nBig claims require substantial evidence. I have been working through the night to aggregate sources so that our community can be adequately informed. Please understand that I am balancing the time-sensitive nature of the \nMarshall Fire disaster with the need to substantiate these claims. Bear with me as I update this post throughout the day.\n\nThe primary contamination I am concerned with is the 903 Area. Barrels were allowed to leak for 11 years into the soil, and distributed throughout the areas indicated in the map below through both continuous processes and \nat least 24 high-wind events. **This is unrelated to the Rocky Flats Plant fires**, which have received the bulk of public attention. Wind and fire events, coupled with ineffective remediation, are absolutely causes for concern.\n\n\n\n## Maps\n\nMarshall Fire vs Plutonium Contamination \n\n\n-\t[Estimated time-integrated concentration of plutonium attached to respirable particles (<15 μm AED) for **903 Area releases (1964–1969).**](https://www.nature.com/articles/7500237/figures/6)\n-\t[Marshall Fire Map](https://web.archive.org/web/20211231175937/https://www.denverpost.com/2021/12/31/marshall-fire-map-perimeter-boulder-county-wildfire/)\n-\t([overlaid](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/the_most_destructive_fire_in_colorado_history/hqwrt99/))\n\n**Edit:** to be clear, the plutonium map above for 903 Area was constructed using 6 years of data. However, the contaminants were continuously leaking for 11 years. **This map doesn’t even factor in illegal dumping of radioactive contaminants in nearby waterways.** \n\n---\n\n## What was the Rocky Flats Plant?\n\nThe [Rocky Flats Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant) was a nuclear weapons manufacturing facility. The plant had two main \"production missions\": \n manufacture nuclear weapons triggers, called [plutonium pits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_(nuclear_weapon)), and process plutonium from \n[retired nuclear warheads](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/29/006/29006042.pdf).\n\n\nIt was located in Jefferson County, CO (just south of Superior) and \n[\"was operated by Dow Chemical as a nuclear weapons production, research, and development facility\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/7500237). For the purposes of discussion here, the site was under the control of the Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by Dow Chemical Company, and later Rockwell International (you can see dates and some finer details on the Wikipedia page).\n\n\n\n## The Rocky Flats Plant was so dangerous it nearly had a Chernobyl-scale event **twice**\n\nI wanted to start by discussing the reckless way the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) conducted its routine operations. Several commenters have brought up the historic fires. I will briefly cover these, as they give context for scale of danger associated with this facility. However, **the main point of this post is related to Area 903** which did not, to my knowledge, experience fires. This does not make it any less dangerous. This detail is critical because any claim that the RFP fires have no bearing on the 2021 Marshall Fire is irrelevant to the potential danger, and merely serves as a distraction (possibly for [large corporate interests](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/the_most_destructive_fire_in_colorado_history/hqv1tr1/)).\n\nThe dangers of the RFP can be categorized into events, and continuous processes. Chronologically, these are as follows:\n\n-\tthe 1957 fire (event, building 771)\n-\troutine operation (continuous process, smaller scale fires, buildings 771, 776/777)\n-\t**the 903 Area (continuous process) <-- this is what the map above is showing you**\n-\tthe 903 Area (high wind events)\n-\tthe 1969 Mother's Day fire (event, building 776/777)\n\n---\n\n### 1957 Fire\n\nIncluded for context only. \n\nThe 1957 fire was perhaps the worst accident at RFP, and relatively unknown by the wider Colorado community. At the time, the RFP was in the middle of nowhere, thought to be safely away from Denver. (In reality, an engineering mistake placed the RFP directly upwind of the city).\n\nThe fire was caused in building 771 by spontaneous combustion of plutonium, which can happen at room temperature under certain conditions. Fire and explosions threw radioactive contamination high into the air, and there may even have been a criticality event. (This is disputed, even though evidence supports this narrative.)\n\nYou can view a contamination map of the 1957 fire [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/7500237/figures/5). Detractors will argue that the fire did not contaminate areas involved in the Marshall fire. This is both true and irrelevant. \n\nContinuous processes contaminating the area is what’s relevant to the discussion. These include routine operation and the 903 area. \n\n### Routine Operation \n\nThroughout the 1960s, there were “countless” fires in the plant. As mentioned, \n[metallic plutonium is inherently dangerous as a pyrophoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant),\nmeaning it can ignite spontaneously at room temperature [“when powdered or thinly sliced”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophoricity).\n\n\nFrom [“The day they almost lost Denver”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2968/055004016)\n\n>\t- \tThe plant’s fire department had been called out to hundreds of fires in the years since the 1957 blaze\n>\t- The most serious \\[fire\\] was a 1965 plutonium fire ignited in Building 776-777 when workers tried to unplug a clogged drain.... \\[M\\]ore than 400 employees were contaminated during this accident. Most of them inhaled radioactive particles and received internal exposures from alpha radiation, so their exposures didn’t show up in the plant’s figures for external penetrating radiation caused by beta particles, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n>\t- From 1966 to May 1969 alone, the department responded to 164 fires. \n>\t- Countless other plutonium fires had broken out but were extinguished by workers and the fire department was not even called in. \"There is no good estimate of the number of plutonium fires not reported to the Fire Department,\" a 1969 Rocky Flats document stated. When plutonium filings, or chips, ignited spontaneously, workers dropped the chips into machining oil to put them out. **\"This kind of fire is considered routine,\"** the document noted. \n\nThese routine events (plutonium fires) released contamination into the air and occurred in buildings 771 and 776/777. \n\n\n### 903 Area\n\nThis was an **[outdoors](https://www.google.com/search?q=pad%20903&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-m)** area used to store metal barrels full of radioactive waste (plutonium and oil used to clean components). It is generally known as Pad 903. I use the “903 Area” terminology in order to match the Nature paper. \n\nFrom [Risks to the public from historical releases of radionuclides and chemicals at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site](https://www.nature.com/articles/7500237):\n\nThe 903 Area “served as a waste storage area for barrels containing plutonium-contaminated\ncutting oil and degreasing agents, primarily carbon tetrachloride.” \nOver 4500 barrels were stored here. (The [Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/rocky-flats-historical-public-exposure-studies) reports over 5000 barrels containing over 200,000 gallons of liquids.)\n\n>\tSite personnel reported barrel corrosion and subsequent leakage onto the soil as early as 1962. By 1964, this had become a major issue, and fences were constructed to limit the spread of contamination by intruding wildlife. In 1967, efforts were made to remove the barrels from the 903 Area, repackage the contents, and ship the waste offsite. Barrel removal was completed in June 1968. However, **by late 1968, there was evidence that wind action had transported plutonium-contaminated soil beyond the 903 Area**. In 1969, the area was paved with asphalt to prevent further transport of plutonium-contaminated soil away from the area. The first coat of asphalt was placed over the contaminated area in July 1969, although paving was not completed until November of that year. **High-wind events during January 1969 had already spread the contamination further**, as did the surface grading and leveling operations that took place in March and April 1969 in preparation for paving. Various estimates of the mass of plutonium released to the soil from the leaking barrels ranged from 85 g (230 GBq) to 800 g (2200 GBq).\n\nThe Nature article quoted above estimates releases from the 903 Area over a 6-year period, however  [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/a-september-11th-catastrophe-youve-probably-never-heard-about/261959/) \n reports that **more than 5,000 barrels stood out in the open for 11 years and leaked radioactive material into the soil and groundwater.**  The [Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/rocky-flats-historical-public-exposure-studies) agrees, reporting that barrels were  leaking **from the late 1950s until 1968** when the barrels were removed.\nIt is therefore reasonable to assume that the 903 Area release estimates are higher than reported in the 2004 Nature paper.\n\n**This is the bit most relevant to the Marshall Fire**. All those barrels were sitting outside rusting and leaking contaminates for over a decade. This means that plutonium contamination was picked up by the wind and dispersed in the surrounding area, **including Superior** where the Marshall Fire was in 2021. I am not claiming Rocky Flats burned, but pointing out the face that areas, most likely contaminated (shown by scientific modelling, not direct measurement) were lit aflame in Colorado’s most devastating fire. \n\nThe inference that Superior is plutonium contaminated **does not even take into account the fact that RFP was discovered to be dumping radioactive waste illegally into bodies of water, including a reservoir used for drinking water.**\n\nYou read that properly. RFP was raided by the FBI in 1989, led by Jon Lipsky. After retiring, Lipsky returned to Colorado to continue his work (exposing RFP) as a private citizen. \n\nBrever is another name to pay attention to. She worked at RFP, then managed by Rockwell, and cooperated with the FBI investigation. Rockwell retaliated by [deliberately exposing Brever to radiation](https://reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/_/hqw3l0b/?context=1). She later developed thyroid cancer. \n\n### 1969 Mother’s Day Fire\n\nThis was another serious incident with the potential to cause a nuclear chain reaction. Unlike the 1957 fire, the contaminants didn’t breach the building (this time 776/777). The significance, for the purposes of this discussion, is that the event raised public awareness of the absurd dangers of the facility. \n\nDow’s reaction to the events paints a picture of the nature of RFP’s governance:\n\n>\tThe possibility that \\[the 1969 fire\\] might have resulted in a significant off-site release of plutonium was countered by the observation that it did not happen.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### Cover up and “clean up”\n\nThere’s too much here to do it justice. [Some details](https://reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/_/hqv1pk6/?context=1)\n\nRemediation was superficial and left “hot spots.” ([Here](https://reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/_/hqv1r5n/?context=1))\n\nProperty developers, [both in the 1970s and present day](https://reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rtus8j/_/hqv1tr1/?context=1), have enormous incentive to suppress public knowledge and discussion around the Rocky flats. \n\n___\n\nI posted this before I finished writing and am still making updates. This decision is due to the time-sensitive nature of the Marshall fire and potential impact on our community. My brain dump and notes are in the comment chain below.\n\nI don’t have many more characters left in the text post and will need to reply with comment chains. Maybe I can follow up with another post entirely, who knows.",

Perhaps, some. But there's also big money in everything staying the way it is. The status quo benefits from inaction and apathy. Rich people, corporations, and governments don't want people to reduce consumption patterns or lay flat or revolt or turn to eco-communism.\n\nI'm sure these very same people, legitimate or a psy-op, will come into this thread to tell me how stupid I am and to go have a burger and beer and wait for my inevitable death in 203X.",

My brother who was born in 1995, is a very sensible, smart and refined person, he spends a lot of time simply thinking, asking himself questions about existence.  \nHe basically gave up on life, he doesn't want to be involved in society anymore, it's like he's just existing. He plays mobile games on an iPad all day, every day. He has no goals, no girlfriend, no job, no diploma, no car, no house or flat, no hygiene, a very few friends. My brother decided that there is no point in fighting a battle that's already been lost for years. Climate change should have been dealt with 40 years from now.  \nWhat saddens me is that my brother isn't unique at all, I know so many people who just gave up and are so, so young. The new generations of adults are totally hopeless in terms of facing the future.  \nOlder generations are having a hard time comprehending this type of behavior, they were raised in a world where their main goal in life was to thrive. \"It won't help to be so pessimistic !\" they like to say. We've come to a point where being pessimistic is just being realistic.   \nThey don't realize that a lot of young people today just don't want to grow old, they don't want to see what the future looks like, because it's more than probably extremely dark.  \nMy hometown in France is basically a big ass mall; just shops, everywhere, in the middle of an XVIIIth century city bringing all the tourists and consumers you can think of. I never go out anymore.  \nI decided I don't want to be physically involved in society, I make videos and art earning small money for now, mostly music related, I leave the flat once or twice a week, since all my work resides on the internet.  \nI am honestly tired of this way of living, there's nothing sane about (this) human society, I don't want my future self telling me that everything I once knew and loved is gone.  \nWe deeply and truly want to change the world, but it seems like we were born just in time to see it collapse.  \nWhy didn't they act when it was still time ? Why is it children who are actually doing something now ? I'm not saying they had the power for changes, but they had the responsibility.  \nMy brother isn't so strange, he's what you become when you know much, but all you are given is an iPad.",

I only knew him as the fabricated public persona that he projects and was shocked to find out how much of a charlatan he is and how big his Ponzi scheme has become. As the two videos posted below lay out, his entire business career has been one of megalomaniacal incompetence, fortuitous happenstance, and PR spin. Consider, [for example](https://driving.ca/tesla/features/feature-story/motor-mouth-is-tesla-a-naturally-occurring-ponzi-scheme), that it would take 1,600 years to pay off Tesla's current stock valuation and, despite its measly production numbers, its market cap is about as big as all the ten major auto producers combined. Yet this is the man the mainstream media fawns over as a \"tech visionary.\"  What does it say about a society that glorifies such people while greenwashing the reality of overshoot and ecological collapse?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-FGwDDc-s8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-FGwDDc-s8)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4)\n\nAll economic bubbles burst in time and this one, along with the entire edifice of techno-capitalist industrial civilization, will be no exception. The bottom line is that Elon Musk is just another symptom of our hypercapitalist, tenuously over-extended civilization.",

Meanwhile the store greeter was a woman who seems to be in her twenties and is extremely obese.

        "selftext": "\\[RANT\\] A thought that has been in my mind for past two days.\n\nI have just realized this, that no matter how prepared I am to live in the \"wild\" after collapse (in my head the worst case scenario is living in the forests and relying on the natural resources around me. It's worst bc I know I will die in like a week) we are going to see the absolute worst of humanity. This worst will lead to immense rise in violence against women, kids and minorities. So even if I settle down in a rural area in my country and by some luck successfully adapt with my surroundings to live out the rest of my existence, there is 0% guarantee that I would be safe from violence. I know even now there's no guarantee that I will be 100% safe but man at least there is some assurance. At least my privileged has guaranteed my safety to some extend.\n\nIt just scares the shit out of me. To be frank, I live in a bubble and I know as soon as this society collapses, it is going to burst. Even to this day, a man would back away because I have a boyfriend not because I said no (Edit: mean to say that a guy would happily ignore my No and me telling him to stop but as soon as a man, in this case my bf, is in picture he backs away. This is outrageous and happening in today’s world) So to imagine that when there is uncertainty and war like tensions, the violence will increase tenfold fucking scares me. So many people's facade is going to crumple and they will become the absolute worst version of themselves.\n\nTo conclude, I am not scared of adapting to the post collapse world but I am shit scared of not being able to protect myself of physical violence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Fucking hell. what is wrong with most of you all. I wasn't going to edit or do anything and let this be but god some of you really have some awful lot of shitty things to say. Also, stop with this gun nonsense. I am not american and I cannot own a gun. Believe it or not, collapse will affect the rest of the world as well and not just America, seems like most of you forget that. To the ones saying shit about alpha male/marry a guy/calling this a fake concern/be with a gang/, you all have only legitimized my concern. Turns out some of you really do not know how things function outside of western world and how easy it is for violence to take place within communities.\n\nTo the ones who have given me valuable advice - how to build a community, educating on various combat techniques, recommending literature and other ***useful tips*** \\- thank you. It means a lot to me and I am hearing to your suggestions. And however the collapse happens, slow or fast the truth is it will and it will keep on creating hostile situations day by day. The best I can do is adapt and live.",

        "selftext": "I hope to spread awareness of this across Reddit. This will be a _long_ post. It is just within the character limit. So please take a seat.\n\n***TL;DR***: **America today is not Germany in the 1920s, nor beginning to turn into Nazi Germany. There is a much more recent conflict that the United States is copying. America is hurtling toward a civil war in the same way Yugoslavia did. The combination of economic disparity, civil injustice, gutted or absent social systems, outdated infrastructure, and indifference from the government leads to open conflict. Regardless of your party, politicians are not going to stop it and they’re not going to save you.**\n\nI have put archive links to every source included at the very bottom.\n\n\n\n## America is not Germany\n\nThe United States of America today has too many parallels with the Weimar Republic of Germany in the early twentieth century. In the late 1910s there were a lot of people that held fears about Marxism in western Europe. Fascists in particular were terribly paranoid about it. These people who were proto-Nazis had an unreasonable paranoia about everything from the left. A term began to circulate called “Judeo-Bolshevism”. The was a word for the conspiracy theory that communism was being spread around the world by Jewish people. It named the Jew a virus that introduced communism into the healthy blood of society. It was part of a covert plan to destroy Christianity and Western civilization through communism. That may sound familiar to some of the things QAnon says today.\n\nAnyway, as the Nazi movement picked up steam, Nazi writers and media critics took on German culture. The Weimar Republic was quite the progressive state at the time. It had rights for LGBT people, some of the first recognition of non-binary people, and an abundance of art. A sizable portion of this art was queer in orientation and/or pornographic. The Nazi critics declared this was degenerate and an avenue of communism. To them, it was part of a plot to weaken German culture and allow a left-wing takeover. By the 1920s the term “cultural bolshevism” overtook “Judeo-Bolshevism”. The left were apparently trying to “bolshevize” the nation by taking over kids’ minds with their books and art. Sound familiar to today? The term on the internet now is “cultural marxism”. Fighting it is the basis of those Prager U videos that are so popular around Facebook.\n\nThe Nazis convinced enough people that cultural bolshevism was a threat, and then inched out a win in an open election in 1932. There were three political party factions in Weimar Germany at the time. Similar to how there would be three major parties in the US if Donald Trump splits the Republican Party like he says he wants to. After the Nazi’s victory, there were no more free elections. Other political parties were removed, the [Reichstag fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire) was staged, all elections were suspended until the new ruling elites “could figure out what was going on”.\n\nIn the lead-up to these tectonic events, the Weimar Republic’s economy was in shambles. Germany heavily suffered from post-World War I reparations, pressures from France, and inflation growing worse and worse. This inflation issue of pre-Nazi Germany is oft pointed out as something the US does not currently suffer from, therefore it can’t be moving in the same doomed steps as Germany. That is partially true. Another country experienced hyper-inflation in the 1990s, but only after its civil war started in April of 1992 and the rest of the world passed sanctions against it. I agree, the USA is not following the footsteps of young Nazi Germany, despite Donald Trump’s Beer Hall Putsch on January 6th 2021, mirroring [Hitler’s on November 8th, 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch). The United States is following the path of a more modern civil war, which is the path of Yugoslavia.\n\nYugoslavia was a country that survived World War II fighting off the Nazis without help from the West or the Soviets. Unlike the other countries in the Eastern Europe, this kept them from being indebted to Stalin and thus not obligated to follow all of the restrictions that came with being in [the Eastern Bloc](https://www.pewpewtactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Fall-of-Iron-Curtain.png)^4. Yugoslavia was therefore not a “communist” country. It was not entirely subject to Stalin’s dictatorship with a planned economy; the system which was then and still is now propagandized as “communism”. Yugoslavia was able to more or less freely trade with both the western capitalist powers and the eastern Soviet powers. It was the country with a close realized example to modern socialism. However, being so young, it was not as rich as most western nations, but it was head and shoulders above its eastern neighbors, and growing.\n\nYugoslavia was also wonderfully multicultural. The Catholic Croat, Orthodox Serbs, and Muslim Bosnians were heavily integrated with one another. About 18%, or more than 1 in 5, of marriages were between the different ethnicities. More importantly, they weren’t that different. They were all Slavs. The Bosnian Muslims were not Arabs. The were Slavs that adopted the religion of the Ottomans when they rolled through eastern Europe centuries ago. The Bosnians drank, gambled, listened to rock music, and ogled crushes in the summer like everyone else. They were your next door neighbors. They were at your cousin’s wedding. They were your everyday co-workers. There was little visual difference between a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosnian.\n\nThe leader of this highly impressive country was the much beloved Josip Broz Tito. World leaders made a conscious effort to be his friend, including President Jimmy Carter. When Tito died in 1980, the extreme nationalists fringe movements he was suppressing were then allowed to flourish. Those movements were later encouraged and manipulated by one Slobodan Milošević, the most effective dictator and orchestrator of genocide that the world has never known.\n\nSlobodan Milošević assumed the presidency of Serbia in 1987. With his political expertise and working fluency of English, he grabbed the role of undisputed strongman in Yugoslavia. First, he realized sooner that his counterparts in eastern Europe or the political experts in the West that the Soviet system was doomed. Second, he decided that the only way to survive the collapse while keeping himself in power was to play the nationalist card; tell the Serbs to forget about Yugoslavia and concentrate on fighting their supposed enemies. He didn’t need to write a Mein Kampf; the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences did the job for him with a memorandum in 1986. Milošević easily adopted it as an ideological blueprint for his nationalist agitation. It is not dissimilar from Donald Trump’s [1776 Commission](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/01/19/1776-report-historians-trump/)^22. The Overton window had shifted so far, that hatred through nationalism and its implied consequences were being seriously proposed and discussed by people who had every right to know better.\n\nTito suppressed nationalism and balanced the power of one nationality against another. He sought to stay in power by avoiding war. Milošević, after failing to keep Yugoslavia together as Serbia-first, sought to stay in power by going to war. He orchestrated arming the local Serbs before the fighting broke out, oversaw the inclusions of paramilitary forces from Serbia into Croatia and Bosnia, and ensured the collusion of the Yugoslav National Army. Practices extremely similar to Roger Stone and Micheal Flynn’s promotion of the Oathkeepers and the Proud Boys. [They even used them as personal guards during the January 6th Capitol Insurrection.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-far-right-militia-member-provided-muscle-for-roger-stone-alex-jones-and-former-trump-aide-michael-flynn)^5 [Let’s also not forget how much Donald Trump Hates the military.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRu9vcjAkXJK0MLkL2jtbtf6R8NIOAdahzWQzd5NFic/edit)^6\n\n“The breakup of Yugoslavia is a classic example of nationalism from the top down—a manipulated nationalism in a region where peace has historically prevailed more than war and in which a quarter of the population were in mixed marriages,” wrote then US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman. “The manipulators condoned and even provoked local ethnic violence in order to engender animosities that could be magnified by the press, leading to further violence.” The sounds like the playbook of the Proud Boys and other “patriot groups” in the past couple years. When someone with the level of influence of the President of the United States hammers a nationalist message to “do something” this is the result. It is echoed by all of the media he controls, now in America, and similarly in Yugoslavia.\n\n## National Propoganda\n\nA reporter for the Washington Post, Peter Maass, interviewed Vera and Stana Milanović, two women who fled their homes from the fighting in central Bosnia, and had taken up residence in a newly “cleansed” town, meaning a town that already had the Bosnians murdered and/or run out of it. Vera and Stana were Serbs.\n\n> Vera said it was a pity they had to leave. Her village, after all, had been cleansed of Muslims in the first days of the war. I asked, out of politeness, wether the fighting in the village was heavy.\n\n> “Why no, there was no fighting between Muslims and Serbs in the village,” she said.\n\n> “Then why are the Muslims arrested?”\n\n> “Because they were planning to take over the village. They had already drawn up lists. The names of Serb women had been split into harems for the Muslim men.”\n\n> “Harems?”\n\n> “Yes, harems. Their Bible says they can have harems, and that’s what they were planning to do once they killed our men. Thank God they were arrested first.” She wiped her brow.\n\n> “How do you know they were planning to kill the Serb men and create harems for themselves?”\n\n> “It was on the radio. Our military had uncovered their plans. It was announced on the radio.”\n\n> I glanced at Bogdan [Maass’ interpreter]. Harems? Over the past few months I had heard that the Bosnians bombed themselves and blamed it on the Serbs.I had heard that an Islamic-Vatican-Croatian-Germanic conspiracy had been hatched to kill off the Serbs. But I had not, to date, heard anything about harems.\n\n> …\n\n> “So how do you know the radio was telling the truth?” I asked.\n\n> Stana and Vera stared at me as though I wore no clothes. God, these Americans are dumber than cows. Vera’s kindness evaporated as she flashed the kind of scowl that, I imagined, was deployed against grandchildren who wore farm boots indoors.\n\n> “Why”, she demanded to know, “would the radio lie?”\n\n> I had to give up. It was the polite thing to do, even though Vera translated my silence as confirming the verity of the harem report. She took a triumphant puff of her Marlboro.\n\n> “Did any Muslims in your village harm you?” I asked, softly.\n\n> “No.”\n\n> “Did any Muslim ever do anything bad to you?”\n\n> “No.”\n\n> She seemed offended.\n\n> “My relations with the Muslims in the village were always very good. They were very nice people.”\n\n\n\nIt is disparaging how familiar the flow of this conversation is today if you were to have one with a [QAnon](https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44?t=2260)^10 believer. You can simply substitute the world “Muslim” with “Democrat” or “liberal” whoever else is to the left of the GOP and therefore must be the embodiment of evil. There are even online communities today for people who have loved ones absorbed by QAnon. Take a look at [this post for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lx5196/my_neighbors_want_me_dead/)^1 :\n\n> I live in a cul-de-sac with 8 other houses. Today I found out half of them are q and want me to die. They think my husband is ignorant and uninformed but I am evil. I’m related to roughy 10% of my town so my beliefs are well known, while hubby just won’t engage in political talk with people that aren’t liberal. One house is full of druggies. Two are ex military. One is a typical American family, 3 kids, dog, picket fence, the whole nine. These are all people I’ve been reasonably friendly with, not hanging out or anything but more than happy to keep an eye while they’re away or something. Hubby works with son of one of the military dudes. He heard him talking to some other q folk at his job. They truly believe that we are evil. Hubby less so, but me? I might as well be the devil. I doubt I’m truly in danger but still I am freaked out. Hubby can’t talk to boss as he’s not sure his political leanings but thinks he’s conservative. Can’t call cops for the same reason. Just making sure my house is secure and doors are always locked. I also started keeping a giant can of wasp spray with a 20 foot reach next to the door. I’m not too sure what I’m expecting by sharing this but I had to get it out. Thanks for reading.\n\nThat subreddit, r/QAnonCasualties, has many more disturbing accounts of [people who suffer](https://www.newsweek.com/qanon-casualties-reddit-community-1565501)^7 [from QAnon cultists](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/02/19/qanon-conspiracy-theory-family-members-reddit-forum-469485)^8 and their [family members](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/15/957371294/how-qanon-like-conspiracy-theories-tear-families-apart)^9. But a grassroots cult like QAnon isn’t the only source of this frightening mentality. Whether it is told by Alex Jones, OAN, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, Nick Fuentes, Tim Pool, Tucker Carlson, if a Big Lie is repeated incessantly, loudly, and aggressively enough, people will make it their truth.\n\nIan Traynor, from the Guardian, wrote similar observations on the unfolding madness in the early 1990s. The Serbs were brainwashed by television. The simplicity of that assertion is a reasonable explanation of how an entire nation composed of generally sensible citizens would follow their leader into an abyss of war and ruin. Milošević controlled television absolutely, refusing to let independent stations have any national frequencies. State television maintained a monopoly, and Milošević, from growing up in Stalinism, well understood the power and importance of propaganda. He talked on a daily basis with the director of Radio-Television Serbia, whom he appointed and replaced, as necessary. But the propaganda was still crude and badly produced. When covering the fighting, it was only dead bodies, stiff anchormen, more dead bodies, more stiff anchormen. However, the media succeeded because it imparted a clear, Reganesque message: Milošević was defending Serbs who lived outside of Serbia, and defending Serbia itself from the Islamic-Ustashe dangers lurking at its borders. Simple, clear, effective. The Serbs swallowed it. In a similar situation, so might we. And we have. Look at the Republican Party since 2015 and the QAnon cult. Miloš Vasić, a writer from Vreme magazine, a center of anti-Milošević news, put it like this: “You must imagine a United States with every little TV station everywhere taking exactly the same editorial line—a line dictated by David Duke. You too would have war in five years.”\n\n## Endless Lies\n\nMilošević lied as easily as he breathed. He had become an absolute master at fabrication. You could point to a black wall and ask Milošević what color it was. White, he says. No, you would reply, look at it, that wall there, it is black, it is five feet away from us. He looks at it, then looks at you, then says, The wall is white my friend, maybe you should have your eyes checked. He does not shout in anger. He sounds concerned for your eyesight.\n\nA more recent re-incarnation of this mentality was pointed out by the Department of Homeland Security chief of staff, Miles Taylor, in 2019 when he witnessed it in the then president Donald Trump and his sycophants in the White House:\n\n> The president has been called a pathological liar. I used to cringe when I heard people say that just to score political points, and I thought it was unfair. Now I know it is true. He spreads lies he hears. He makes up new lies to spread. He lies to our faces. He asks people around him to lie. People who’ve known him for year accept it as common knowledge. We cannot get used to this. Think of what we must “trust” a president to do as our chief executive.\n\n> …\n\n> President Trump is fundamentally undermining our perceptions of “truth”. He has taken us down a dark, subjectivist rabbit hole. To him, there is no real truth. If people _believe_ something is true, _that makes it true_. A scientist will tell you a tree is a tree. It cannot be both a tree and a sheep at the same time. Not for the president. A tree is a tree only to him if we all agree it is. If he can convince us it is a sheep, then it _is_ sheep!\n\n> Kellyanne Conway unintentionally summed up the Trumpian philosophy beautifully. She went on _Meet the Press_ and was forced to defend the president’s absurd boast about having the largest ever crowd at his inauguration. To be clear, the president’s claim was easily disproven by facts and photographs and numbers and recorded history and basic human reasoning. Still, Chuck Todd pressed Conway on the subject, to which she responded: “You’re saying it’s a falsehood..[but] Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternate facts.”\n\n> “Wait a minute,” Todd interjected. “Alternate facts? … Alternate facts are not facts. They’re falsehoods.”\n\nIn the same way White House staff defended Donald Trump’s fabricated reality, Milošević had sycophants of his own.\n\nRadovan Karadžić was a bear of a man. He was one of Milošević’s top generals who enthusiastically carried out the genocide. The most remarkable thing about Karadžić was his lack for telling lies with disarming sincerity. Not little lies, white lies, or deceptions, but whooping lies, lies that were so big, and so incredible, that you wanted to laugh and say, in response, Hold on, Radovan, you expect me to believe this? Karadžić was [a real Mike Pompeo in his conduct](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/24/798579754/transcript-nprs-full-interview-with-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo)^11 .\n\nA press conference in Žepa, at the tail end of 1992, displayed this personality of Karadžić in all of its glory. The questions were about the causes of the war, the tactics, the destruction, the war crimes, and so on. Karadžić responded enthusiastically, explaining that No, Serbs were not bombing Sarajevo, the “Muslims” were doing all that and blaming it on the Serbs. What about the Serb prison camps? Surely he couldn’t deny the pictures of emaciated prisoners who looked as horrible as survivors of Auschwitz.\n\n“We opened our prisons to the media, and the media focused on one very thin boy,” Karadžić said, speaking in English. “All the other prisoners were good-looking, but the media only focused on this one skinny boy. He was skinny, that’s all. Maybe he had cancer. I was skinny like that when I was a young boy.” He smiled and rubbed his considerable belly.\n\n“The Muslims want to force the Serbs to live under _sharia_,” referring to the Islamic holy law. “Our women would be forced to wear chadors. …”\n\n“We do not want to conquer Sarajevo. We should divide the city with the Muslims. It can be like Beirut. …”\n\n“There was no ethnic cleansing as part of our policy. Never. We never contributed to the shifting people. The Muslims wanted to compulsively leave. We couldn’t stop them from leaving. …”\n\n“I don’t see what’s wrong with a Greater Serbia. There’s nothing wrong with Great Britain, so what’s wrong with Greater Serbia?”\n\nThe things Karadžić said were lies, and these lies were being broadcast worldwide, every day, several times a day, and they were being taken seriously. His lies didn’t need to be accepted as truth, but they were obscuring the truth, causing outsiders to stay on the sidelines. Karadžić didn’t need to make outsiders believe his version of events; he just needed to make them doubt the truth and sit on their hands. [This kind of conduct should be familiar.](https://youtu.be/W6XdpDOH1JA)^12\n\nOne example of Milošević’s genius is that he tolerated a surprising amount of free speech. He was willing to harass or detail anyone who was a real threat, but few people were, and so Belgrade was crawling with dissidents and professors who quite openly called Milošević a fascist. Saddam would have cut off their heads, creating ten new enemies for every one he executed. Milošević let them ramble on, and the opposition, which chanted “Slobo, Saddam” at protests, remained pathetically weak.\n\nAsk what strategy will keep Milošević in power, and that is the one he will follow. Every time. All of these things he talks about, like nationalism and protecting the Serbs, are just tools he uses to stay in power. He doesn’t care about them at all. He doesn’t care about anyone at all. He cares only about staying in power.\n\nThat methodology should should extremely familiar to Americans in 2021. Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, William Barr, just to name a few, are all powerful politicians that live and breathe this everyday. Especially [Mitch](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/842579283/mitch-mcconnells-calculated-decision-to-become-trump-s-enabler-in-chief-explaine)^3 [McConnell.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-coronavirus-laugh_n_5f850bffc5b62f97bac6e12d)^2\n\n\n## Living in the Conflict\n\nThe city of Sarajevo, more than any other in Europe, was a symbol of integration and tolerance. You could find, on virtually the same block, a Muslim mosque, a Roman Catholic cathedral, a Christian Orthodox Church, and a Jewish synagogue. The people of Sarajevo—Muslims, Serbs, Croats, Jews, Albanians, Romani, and a kaleidoscope of mixtures therein—lived in Europe’s truest melting pot.\n\nOn April 6th, 1992, the Holiday Inn in Sarajevo was being used as the unofficial headquarters for Radovan Karadžić’s Serbian Democratic Party. On that day, when the peace demonstrators gathered in an adjacent park, a few of Karadžić’s goons opened fire from the rooftop and upper floors. For Sarajevo, those shots marked the start of the war.\n\nAs Americans have learned one year ago with the outbreak of COVID-19, and as Texans are experiencing right now, supermarkets only have a 3-day supply of food on-hand at the maximum. There is no backroom in stores anymore. The Just-In-Time Supply Chain method of goods is extremely efficient in a capitalist society, but also extremely fragile. If the supply line gets interrupted from say, a pandemic, a terrorist attack, climate change, or a war, then people are in breadlines and surplus rots in farmers’ fields. Sarajevo suffered such a breakdown. Fruits, eggs, meat, flour, fish, and gasoline became extremely precious commodities. The only way to get them was the black market, if you had connections and were lucky.\n\nThe infrastructure hit caused blackouts through the entire country. For Sarajevo, that also meant your house or apartment was not heated in the winter. Residents jerry-rigged wood-burning stoves which had their exhaust pipes piercing the wall to outside. People chopped the trees and benches in parks to use for firewood.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to find gasoline on the black market and had a generator, you could have electricity for a little while. Like in the Holiday Inn, which had satellite TV, and residents could view CNN and watch their own genocide from the outside world. There was also MTV, and Bosnian television which broadcast an array of films; from _The Blues Brothers_ to _The Great Gatsby_ and _Blazing Saddles_. You had to be careful though. No one has electricity and lights on around the clock. French General Philippe Morillon who was working for the UN forces did, thanks to his provided military generator. His residence a target of nighttime shellings and strafings, since the brightly lit building was the only one the Serbs in the hills could see, so they fired at it.\n\nKarlo and Janja Pelzl were a Catholic couple in Sarajevo. They lived not far from the Holiday Inn, and would count the number of direct mortar hits to their building. Bits of shrapnel and a sniper bullet or two might crash through their windows from time to time. Karlo, a devout Catholic, still went to church every Sunday. Even though he had to dodge sniper fire in the streets and worry about being blown up when he received communion. Janja and Karlo went to mass at separate churches. This was not due to marital issues or preferences with priests, but because they were afraid that if they went to the same church, and it was bombed, their children would be left without parents. The couple still left home to go to work, or to search for food, but they never departed at the same time. One would stay behind and wait until the other was far enough away that a single mortar shell could not kill both of them.\n\nIn the countryside, things were not much better. The Associated Press ran an eyewitness account on April 6th, 1993, from Haris Nezirović, a Bosnian journalist. Here he describes the scrambles for parachuted food:\n\n> During the first month of airdrops, at least 15 people were crushed, stabbed, or shot to death in the nightly fights for food. On March 11th alone, five people were reported killed. Two days later there were three more deaths—a mother suffocated in a crush, a woman killed when a bundle landed on her and another person stabbed her to death. The hunt for food begins every night as darkness falls. Crowds stream from the town into the nearby hills—elderly hobbling on sticks, soldiers who have deserted the front lines, wounded men on crutches, entire families. They traverse muddy or icy paths, cross streams and struggle up steep, slippery slopes. Some trek from villages 15 miles away and return home in the morning. Reaching the hilltops, they disperse among the trees, light fires for warmth, and wait. Exhausted elderly people sit with their faces contorted in pain as they struggle to catch their breath. There is no way of knowing where the parachutes will drift down, and the wait can be for nothing if the bundles land too far away. Some families separate to boost the chances that one member will be in the right place.\n\nAt the beginning of the conflict, Serbs with hunting rifles—drunk hillbillies—set up roadblocks around some villages. This was to enforce that the area was under Serb control. In their mind, they had to stop the Muslim insurgents from attacking the Serbs. This is almost identical, **identical** to the [armed checkpoints set up in the pacific northwest last year by MAGA cultists during the wildfires](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/us/oregon-armed-checkpoints-wildfires-looting-trnd/index.html)^13 . Those MAGA cultists, militia men, Patriot Prayer types, were [looking for “antifa”](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/13/912449209/oregon-officials-warn-untrue-antifa-rumors-waste-precious-resources-for-fires)^14 or looters or [suspected arsonists](https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-wildfires-woman-seen-holding-suspected-arsonist-at-gunpoint)^15 (for a natural wildfire, yes), or anyone they considered suspicious or undesirable. They [took pictures of people’s license plates or approached cars armed and ready](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/16/oregon-fires-armed-civilian-roadblocks-police)^16. The police there, unsurprisingly, were [happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZHY4RE_GLA)^17 to assist them [and urge them on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vdxl_7xhAI)^18.\n\nElsewhere in the Yugoslav countryside, villages were “cleansed” of Bosnians with the surviving captives relocated to death camps. In the more diverse regions, trucks rumbled past with soldiers who shouted to no one in particular “Serbia!”, a slogan full of meaning to goons with guns. The integration of some parts of the country, not dissimilar from Sarajevo, posed a question: What do you do with such a large number of undesirable minorities? It is easy to bomb and cleanse isolated villages or towns, tossing to survivors into a camp, but it’s something else to do this to larger settlements that you already control and don’t want to destroy. The solution was simple: Squeeze them out slowly, like dishwater from a towel. A few killings here, a rape or two there, job dismissals everywhere, confiscation of apartments. Scare them enough and they will want to leave.\n\nThings were so bleak that Muslims and Croats in such situations wanted the US Air Force to bomb _them_ so that they would be taken out of their misery. That is not a joke. People who had the misfortune to not be a Serb, and trapped without hope of fleeing, pleaded for America to preform mass euthanasia with F-16s. In Banja Luka children were staying indoors. Knife etchings in trees that used to say things like “Bogdan Loves Senada” were joined now by “Death to Muslims”. ([Actions not much different from the antics of the white nationalists, neo-nazis, and groypers of today.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/02/24/woman-accused-of-stealing-nancy-pelosis-laptop-appears-in-video-making-nazi-salute/]))^19 An old Muslim woman had this much to say: “We live in fear,” she cried. “We wait every night for Serbs to come and slaughter us. If only the Americans would just bomb us with their planes and get it over with.” The city of Goražde, a Bosnian enclave, was a city that suffered similar attacks by Serbian forces. The mayor pleaded to foreign journalists over HAM radio: “Gather the courage to bomb us,” Ismet Briga said in a message to Bill Clinton. “Stop the agony of the people of Goražde. We beg for airstrikes against the citizens of Goražde!”\n\nIn America, we have a hard time understanding why people in Bosnia are willing to suffer so much in a futile war. The goal of imperial wars, which we are most familiar with, is to conquer and rule. The goal of nationalist wars, as in Bosnia, is to conquer and cleanse. The contests are winner-takes-all. When you are faced with enemies who wish to expunge you from your land, and when those enemies offer a treaty that ensures their boots will stay on your throat, suffocating you one day, you have little choice but to keep struggling, even though the odds are against you and people who call themselves your friends are saying you should give up.\n\n## Social Breakdown Goes Deep\n\nIn 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics. If you had been there at the time, and if you had asked any Yugoslav whether he could imagine his city falling into war in eight years time, he would have laughed out loud and tried to detect the slivovitz on your breath, and if he didn’t detect any, he might have excused himself and walked to the nearest police officer to report a madman on the loose. Now fast-forward to a year before the war began. Yugoslavia is falling apart. A few months before the fighting started, a Washington Post reporter interviewed Muslims, Serbs, and Croats living in the same apartment building in Sarajevo, living right next to each other. And, in the case of the many mixed marriages, shared the same bed and gave their children a Serb first name, a Muslim last name, and perhaps, in honor of their best friend, a Croat middle name. These people said there could be no war, no, never, because no one wanted it, and war would not make sense.\n\nBy 1992 the Serb forces believed they were fighting a war against the “fundamentalist” Muslims and the “fascist” Croats. “Turks” became a derogative word for Bosnia’s Muslims. Serb propaganda told their soldiers that Bosnia’s Muslims were Koran-waving fanatics trying to set up an Islamic state in which Serb women would be forced to wear chadors. At any moment the “Turks” could storm up the mountains that the Serbs were “defending”. Sarajevo had to be liberated from these “Turks”, and that meant destroying it or forcing the “Turks” to surrender and accept partition of the prized capital as well as the country.\n\nWhen propaganda cuts this far and this deep, the people targeted and persecuted by it sometimes begin to adopt it just to survive. In circumstances like this, just as resistance is natural, so, unfortunately, is radicalization. Feeling betrayed by America and Europe, the Muslim leadership in Bosnia began turning away from Western notions of pluralism, and focused on Muslim nationalism. It was the cruelest of self-fulfilling prophecies: The Western world viewed them as Muslims, not Europeans, so they became Muslims, tough Muslims. In the Center for the Investigation of War Crimes and Crimes of Genocide, located in Zenica, a new and disturbing alliance was on display. On the wall was a picture of Ali Khamenei, Iran’s spiritual leader, and underneath it was a 600-word statement, in Bosnian, that assailed Western countries refusing to lift the arms embargo. It said that Iran stood ready to help its stricken brethren in the Balkans.\n\nIn Vitex, central Bosnia, Cathy Jenkins and Adam LeBor from the BBC, Peter Maass from the Washington Post, and his interpreter Sasha Radas stayed at Kasem’s Gas Station for a night while en-route to a British base. There was a mortar strike in the night and the station was attacked by men in camouflage without insignias and wielding AKs. The four reports crawled through the hallway and into the stairwell as bullets ripped through the windows. When the gunfire ceased, a burly soldier in a balaclava burst into the station. The four shouted that they were journalists and held up their UN press cards. The man ignored them, proceeded to break open every door he could find, and pumped some rounds down the basement stairs, where the journalists were initially planning to hide. Another masked soldier with bloodshot eyes entered the station. When Radas questioned “Who are you?” The soldier smiled and answered “Ustashe.”\n\nThe Ustashe were Croatia’s World War II-era pro-Nazi movement. They prided themselves on being more brutal than the SS. The Ustashe did not prioritize efficiency when they murdered the Jews and undesirables back in WWII. Instead, they reveled in the brutalities they could commit. Fifty years later in 1993, the Croat extremists in Bosnia proudly referred to themselves as Ustashe.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, what happened to Yugoslavia was not a Balkan explosion, but a violent process of national breakdown at the hands of political manipulators. Violent breakdowns occur in any country during times of economic hardship, political transition, or moral infirmity; such troubles create opportunities for manipulators, and manipulators create opportunities for atrocities. The Yugoslav conflict was massively more complicated than what I have been able to summarize here. There more angles to it, historically and modern, especially from the Croats, that I could not convey well here. Regardless, civil war, insurgency, counter-insurgency, revolution, troubles, whatever you want to call it, it has no clear start. It doesn’t happen overnight. The build-up can take _years_. It is not two defined sides duking it out. It is a jigsaw of competing territories and factions. A whirlwind of murder and fear and terrorism for everyone trapped in it.\n\nI could triple the length of this post talking about how George Bush allowed this tragedy to come to fruition by loudly ignoring it. I could write even more than I could about George Bush, by writing about Bill Clinton’s response, or deliberate lack of one. Bill committed to nothing, backpedaled, claimed his hands were tied by the opposition party. It would be comical how little things change if the consequences weren’t so dire.\n\nI could go on about the hemming and hawing from Bill Clinton, about his hypocrisy, his gall to proudly open the Holocaust Museum in April of 1993, while simultaneously allowing prison camps to continue in the Yugoslav countryside. Death camps which Clinton refused to acknowledge or intervene in. How he half-heartedly committed to airstrikes, and even then toned down those airstrikes, until the very end. And as a final display of tyrannical indifference after the lopsided negotiations in Dayton Ohio, Izetbegović, Bosnia’s president, left a bitter man, and Milošević hugged one of the American generals out of glee. But all of that politicking about America’s role in the Yugoslav war is not relevant to the point here: that the pattern seen in Yugoslavia in the late 80s and early 90s is happening here in America right now in the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\n\nWhy should any of this matter? Trump is gone. He lost the re-election. We should all go back to brunch right? No. He evaded two impeachments. He can still hold office. “We will be back in sone form.” And he’s right. Trumpism is still here. His followers haven’t left. His [sycophants](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article249241890.html)^20 haven’t left. His [worshipers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-standing-ovation-b1797361.html)^21 haven’t left. The Nazi Party was never the popular majority. Even when it was ruling, only a very small percentage actually wanted genocide. But that’s really all it takes. \"Only about a third of this group is actively campaigning for your death. Another third is neutral to it, while the last third sort of disapproves and will disappointedly shake their head, but do absolutely nothing about it as they watch you die.”\n\nThe deep damage Donald Trump has exposed and worsened in the American people will be here for quite some time. Joe Biden is not going to save you and he never was. Please remember, there were a bunch of Germans and a bunch of Italians who just loved their country. They loved what they heard and they didn’t see the danger or understand what was happening because they had fallen for somebody who was charismatic on some level. It is no longer a question of “It can’t happen here” or even admitting that “It can happen here”, it is happening here.\n\n\nParting note: the big things usually happen when it’s hot. It is the \"Arab Spring\" and the \"Summer of Love\" for a reason. Late spring/early summer is when it gets warm enough to be outside for long periods. When it’s warm outside and people don’t have jobs, like in an economically impacted nation, you see mass gatherings of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Archived backup links:\n\n1 - [QAnon post](https://archive.vn/uMxL6)\n\n2 - [McConnell](https://archive.vn/0nXBc)\n\n3 - [Mitch](https://archive.vn/ybhyH)\n\n4 - [Eastern Bloc](https://imgur.com/VcWrPUg)\n\n5 - [Militia guards](https://archive.vn/Q5cSd)\n\n6 - [Donald hates the troops](https://archive.vn/1O0J6)\n\n7 - [people who suffer from QAnon](https://archive.vn/CTQNZ)\n\n8 - [invasive QAnon](https://archive.vn/CWLMd)\n\n9 - [QAnon tearing families apart](https://archive.vn/JA1J8)\n\n10 - [What QAnon is](https://youtu.be/JTfhYyTuT44?t=2260)\n\n11 - [Mike Pompeo](https://archive.vn/eCm8l)\n\n12 - [Lies to obscure](https://youtu.be/W6XdpDOH1JA)\n\n13 - [Armed checkpoints in Oregon](https://archive.vn/9vLVQ)\n\n14 - [looking for “antifa”](https://archive.vn/prHk4)\n\n15 - [supposed arsonists](https://archive.vn/tvBHl)\n\n16 - [police and vigilantism](https://archive.vn/A3DK6)\n\n17 - [police in Oregon 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZHY4RE_GLA)\n\n18 - [police in Oregon 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vdxl_7xhAI)\n\n19 - [white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and groypers](https://archive.vn/KwI31)\n\n20 - [sycophants](https://archive.vn/eb7wW)\n\n21 - [worshipers](https://archive.vn/OKim9)\n\n22 - [1776 Report](https://archive.vn/4kkXM)",

At least millennials had a slither of a chance to grab onto the last rung of the ladder being pulled up in front of them. Zoomers are fucked, the ladder is finally out of reach for normal people now.\n\nWhat is the point in working 40+ hour weeks, when you have no security, cannot save any money, can't afford your own place and no reason to believe you'll ever receive a pension.\n\nI really feel like we are on the brink of a big societal change. We are already seeing it happen with fast food chains. But this will only perpetuate into more industries. In fact supermarkets are already having a hard time keeping stocked because the entire supply chain is fucked. Abattoirs & meat processing factories, fruit pickers, HGV drivers & shelf stackers are all having a bad time finding enough employees to keep things running smoothly.\n\nIn the UK the public sector has faced pay freezes for years, with news coming out recently that nurses will receive below inflation salary increases and teachers face yet another year of pay freezing. Why would young people bother training to join those professions? They just won't. \n\nWhat is going to happen when an entire generation strike and countries find themselves without workers in critical roles?\n\nAt what point will young people just say fuck it, I refuse to be part of this system?",

The only one that is vaguely left-of-center is /r/WayOfTheBern. But right now I see /r/neoliberal, /r/GoldAndBlack, and /r/Conservative. I mean let's not even touch ancaps for a second, why would I see two subs that are literally pro-BAU (neoliberal and conservative) in that tab?\n\nConversely, in the text-based Related Communities (that's been there for years) we see not only actual collapse-related support subs, but also subs like /r/antiwork and /r/latestagecapitalism, etc, which are anti-BAU. So this tells me that the redesign \"Related Communities\" is probably auto-generated from traffic and not something the mods are doing purposely, but if that's the case *then we're definitely getting traffic from a lot of BAU and even reactionary places.*\n\nIt's not a complete shitshow NOW (and tbf the mods' decision not to post into /r/all was a great move tbh), but if /r/antiwork is any indication, is that a big subreddit needs to really protect against huge influx of people who can change the environment for the worse (no pun intended). In antiwork's case, it was the influx of milquetoast liberals that defanged all the radical theory of the movement (along with mod incompetence/arrogance). I don't want this sub to just eventually turn into eco-fash or reactionaries once this sub grows big (and it will). I'm pretty sure the mods are keeping watch, but as someone who's been here a while, I'm just really concerned.",

        "selftext": "Traveling during the election season was insane, seeing the news cycles only talking about trump made me sick, seeing what was actually happening around the country. It’s so much worse than I ever thought and it makes me want to scream. You really have to go further than the interstate towns to even notice. Middle America is fucking crumbling and nobody is talking about it. Oh and did I mention. \nWhere are the birds?\n\nIt starts with the Dollar General. That’s usually the first stoke of death for an American town. It slowly leeches revenue from the already struggling grocery store until it goes out of business. Now everyone has to drive 40 minutes to get to the nearest grocery store. The “downtown” starts to die as businesses close. There is no longer any inventive to live there. And then the pandemic hit. I’ve done a road trip like this before but it was 5 years ago. Going back to the places I was before and seeing how they are now is extremely depressing. There is an insane amount of garbage piling up in the front yard of rural America, more than any landfill could fit. But nothing can prepare you for the west coast. I wanted to enjoy the cities but I couldn’t. I hated every city I went to because of the amount of homeless there was, I never felt calm knowing my car was just parked without me near it there. The next time you drive into Seattle, look into the woods on your way in. Miles and miles of homeless living in the woods on the outskirts. So. Many. Tents. You’re not even safe in the desert in California. Driving through slab city at night is like a fucking horror movie. An old lady with a purple dress and a shopping cart was in the middle of the road and I had to swerve around her going 50 (no Civilization anywhere near) and you can see the silhouettes of the homeless under the moonlight in the desert at a distance. Some threatened me with a knife to leave their “spot”. It’s not just the west coast though. Even in Arizona, in the middle of nowhere on blm land, 2 am and zero degrees out, with no civilization for 40 miles, a homeless guy opened my car door and shoved his face into mine and begged me for a blanket. Traumatizing, and it made me not even feel bad when a homeless guy broke into my car a week later and stole my blankets and clothes and food ,but not my camera. It’s shit like that that’s staying with with me. It’s a painful feeling seeing it all and knowing there’s nothing I can do to help them.\n\nI didn’t see nearly as many birds as I thought I would, in fact, I hardly saw any besides crows and ravens until I got to the ocean. Even after going to and hiking/backpacking through every national park and everything in between them. I never needed my bug nets that I made. Very concerning\n\nPlease make effort to go experience Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota, it’s going to burn to the ground if not this summer then next summer. I was lucky I got to experience Rocky Mountain National Park a week before it burned down. Many areas in the Tetons and wind river range are going to go up in flames soon as well, the pine bark beetle has killed almost all of the pines there in many areas and it’s spreading fast, but the trees haven’t burned yet so it’s still pretty there! \nPoint is, America is crumbling from the bottom up, and it’s kind of like the frog in boiling water. Except It’s been simmering for a longgg time, and I’m not sure when it’s going to boil. Go see it all while gas is cheap before everything burns!✌️",

        "selftext": "And I'm here to tell you that it's very unlikely. I'm a non-profit legal aid attorney whose work has been >90% landlord-tenant law for the past year and a half. These are just my non-scientific personal observations but my sample size is higher than most because I've interacted with hundreds of low-income clients facing eviction. \n\nMy number one take-away is that poor people in America are largely self-hating, beaten down, and feel a deep sense of shame. Some even sympathize with the landlords and said they would evict too if the roles were reversed. I have to continuously remind folks they are NOT \"freeloading\" under the CDC moratorium because they are accruing a rent debt each month with interest. \n\nThe few people who I see who are really mad are the newly poor. Middle and high income earners who lost hours or jobs during the pandemic through no fault of their own, had zero or little savings, and are now shell shocked and furious as they discover first hand about the woeful state of this country's social safety nets. Unfortunately, most of these people don't hold on to their anger and I see depression and apathy replace it over the months I've worked with them. And ones who are still angry only talk about lawsuits; they just want to address their personal grievances, not change the laws or the system.\n\nWe desperately need some type of left-wing populist movement in this country, because the judges are all on the side of property (eviction data show that tenants lost over 95% of cases in my judicial circuit even before the pandemic) and the laws are written by and for the wealthy. When the game is rigged, we need extrajudicial tactics: rent strikes, tenant unions, and eviction sit-ins to stand up to the courts and police. But I don't have a lot of confidence in this developing even in the aftermath of the pandemic. We should never underestimate the ability of the American underclass to absorb new injustices and outrages because this is the most brainwashed populace on the planet. Most of my clients don't want socio-economic change - they just want to have their slice of the pie.\n\nI hope I'm wrong but I'd still suggest tempering your expectations for what will happen.",

        "selftext": "Edit: I'm seeing a lot of people asking what I studied. I studied film and media. And in response to that, many people have messaged me or commented that its my fault that I studied something I'm passionate about and am complaining about being unemployed. But if there's no point in studying something you're passionate about, then what IS the point? Why survive doing something you hate? Honestly, if our only chance of survival is mindless drones working for corporation, then collapse is already here. \n\nI see a lot of posts about millennials, and I also think a lot of their hardships applies to Gen-Z as well.\n\nI just graduated college in May. Every single one of my friends is living with their parents, and only 8/38 of my close friends are employed. The rest are either unemployed, had jobs out of college and had their offer rescinded, or was rejected from every single job they applied to and are doing graduate school as a way to pass the time. I graduated with a 3.9, Summa Cum Laude from a respectable college and am unemployed. I applied to 170+ jobs over the course of 7 months (January to July) through a variety of different methods and to a variety of different industries/states and didn't get a single interview. I've worked before and have founded clubs etc. I did all of this stuff under the impression that this was the rite of passage for employment and that everything would work out, just like it did for my parents. We were all motivated to pursue our dream careers, but graduating into this has made us un-motivated beyond our imaginations.\n\nEvery single person I know has these beliefs:\n\n1. Hard work doesn't pay off.\n2. The system is rigged against you and only luck and nepotism will work.\n3. Our species is screwed because of climate change and we won't live past this century,\n4. Don't aspire for dream jobs or lives, aspire to be employed or be able to afford a house in the future.\n\nIn addition we've become de-sensitized to global civil unrest, corruption in politics, poverty, crime, wage disparities etc. People no longer aspire to be lawyers, or doctors, they aspire to be social media influencers or OnlyFans stars. Intellectual thinking is no longer as important as it once was. I have no idea how this will shape us down the line, but I know Gen-Z is doomed to a similar Millennial fate. Perhaps worse as my move further towards idiocracy.\n\nThe worst part is the advice we get from parents, family members, and generally any older generation who are all separated from reality. Many think climate change is reversible. Many think Covid is just a flu. Many think we're lazy for not finding a job and living with them. Many believe we can simply just pivot to another life plan if things don't work out now. Many think we're choosing a mindset of doom and gloom.\n\nAnd these are the people in power. We all really do feel like we're watching the last days of Rome, and we're screaming at deaf ears.",

        "selftext": "The CDC has always advised everyone to get the flu vaccine each year.\n\nThe take rate for the flu vaccine has never gone much above 50% of the USA and no one in government did anything about it. There was no major outcry over this low take rate in the media either.\n\nIn the 2017-2018 flu season [52,000 people died](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm). Hospitals were heavily overloaded when that happened, stacking bodies in trailers, [building tent encampments](https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/). Prior to the pandemic even a moderate flu season would put a heavy burden on hospitals. Our healthcare system was at or beyond max capacity during flu season and no one in government made an effort to push vaccination as a necessity. \n\nGovernment also did not push any other alternative for stemming that tide such as mandatory paid sick leave or promoting masking during flu season. The business side of healthcare had no interest in doing more than the bare minimum since profits are all they care about. \n\nAll of this meant that healthcare providers were just expected to deal with being underpaid and understaffed all the time.\n\nThis system was guaranteed to collapse if a pandemic happened and we had ample warning that a pandemic could occur. Previous widespread outbreaks of SARS and MERS in other countries pointed to the imminent danger of something like this occurring. There were numerous experts pointing to the possibility of a pandemic occurring.\n\nThe only reason corporations and government care now is because the wheels of the economy that used to grind through all those dead bodies during flu season are getting stuck.\n\nThe corporate for-profit healthcare system and their political allies, who knew they had a shitty vaccine take rate for decades, have foisted a leaky vaccine on us as the solution to this pandemic. A vaccine they now admit [does not prevent you from getting and spreading COVID](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html). They have scapegoated individuals for not getting the vaccine as the reason for the ongoing pandemic and the burden on the healthcare system, but there was never any chance that the vaccines would solve the problem and they were never going to convince half the country to start getting vaccinated after decades of not caring.\n\nThe reality is that healthcare providers are underpaid, facilities are understaffed and this has been the case for decades. Most workers (even and especially healthcare workers) are not allowed to take paid time off when they are sick and because of deepening income inequality most of them cannot afford to take unpaid time off. Even if a worker could afford to take time off most businesses are cut so far to the bone on staffing and labor protection is so minimal that companies will fire a worker that takes time off for being sick and hire someone else that won't take time off.\n\nThe result is that any communicable disease spreads like wildfire through our country.\n\nThe system was always going to fail in this situation.\n\n———\n\n—- EDIT:—- \n\nThere will probably be a mix of incredulity, surprise and disappointment when I say that I’m triple vaxxed. I don’t care if you think I’m lying, but I’m not. \n\nNotice how any criticism of the corporate owned government method for getting us out of this crisis, that solely being a leaky vaccine, is immediately met with a coterie of people completely indoctrinated into calling out “anti-vaxxer” and/or criticizing me for not lauding the vaccine for ameliorating symptoms as an excuse for it not effectively curbing transmission.\n\nI never said once in this post not to get vaccinated or that the vaccine has no effect on symptoms. I said that this vaccine isn’t going to fix the problem and that problem is the corporate owned system that prioritizes profit over health. \n\nWe’re already well on the way into the part where they try to normalize the deaths that occur from this disease. They send everyone back to work again with no mandatory sick leave and a vaccine that ameliorates symptoms so they can work sick. People that are vaccinated and that catch COVID transmit it just as well as people that are unvaccinated.\n\nWhen people keep dying on a regular basis like they do with the flu people will have their scapegoats and it will be the unvaccinated and not the corporations and politicians that sent workers back into the meat grinder.",

Couple that [with the fact that fast fashion consumers wear an item 7 times on average before it goes to the landfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/o91100/oof_its_painful_to_watch/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) or worse, [no longer trendy items end up in third-world countries ruining local clothing makers business' and filling their shores with rubbish](https://youtu.be/YnKEJprS3xM), and people willingly purchasing items [from companies using forced labour](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale) and we have a recipe for ruin. When consumerism and carbon footprint comes up someone always argues along the lines of \"Hurr durr, carbon footprint is a way for corps to shift the blame on the small people when it's their big nasty factories that cause the pollution not us forgetting to close the tap when brushing our teeth\". The problem is, without demand there would be no profit and thus supply. The average people's appetite to consume feeds into practices that are ruining our planet. What really depressed me and really drove the above statement home was a completely innocent conversation with a colleague of mine during our lunch break. She was checking how much would it be to upgrade from her current iPhone to the latest iPhone before her two-year contract ends. She was doing this research on her iPhone 12, which is in an immaculate shape. Why does she need the new one? Because the new one comes in *pink*. Her current device is purple but pink is her favourite colour thus she needs the new phone. Nevermind the [staggering amount of toxic waste these devices produce](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/environment/the-hidden-environmental-toll-of-smartphones/) or that [buying a new phone takes as much energy as using one for an entire decade](https://www.fastcompany.com/90165365/smartphones-are-wrecking-the-planet-faster-than-anyone-expected). One of my other colleagues also mentioned how he never spends more than £10 for a shirt (even brand new). Can you imagine how much money the person sewing that garment makes if a shirt that has to designed, the fabric for it created, sewn, shipped to the opposite corner of the world costs just £10 when it reaches the consumer?\n\nAnd we haven't even touched on [food waste](https://youtu.be/6RlxySFrkIM)\n\nEveryone is quick to say \"Oh, it's not all doom and gloom\" but I am losing hope.\n\n\n**Update**: So I went to sleep and by the time I woke up the comments just exploded. I read them as I have my morning coffee! Your insightful  comments do have an effect on my thinking and in fact some did make me think and amend my existing beliefs. Chief among them is my thoughts on overpopulation.  u/Dr_seven 's reply to my overpopulation comment really helped to nuance my thoughts on the matter. Regarding corps: you are 100% right in blaming them, I believe they should be heavily regulated because they don't moderate themselves. \n\nAlso thanks for not making fun of my use of \"generic\" instead of \"general\", damned autocorrect got me again!",

EVERYBODY I know is suffering from a physical ailment, a mental health struggle, or both. Everyone. And as a result, everyone has a fuse about an inch long. People are bitter, angry, and antagonistic. I'm seeing people ready to chop each other's heads off over the most minor inconveniences and burdens. Road rage is out of control and people in general just don't seem to have respect for each other anymore. Frankly, I'm seeing a lot more people act entitled, too.\n\nI'm only 21 so I can't claim to know what the \"good old days\" were like, but something seems very off. People my age throw themselves one of two ways: they're heavy drinkers and partiers, searching for just five minutes they can get their minds off the burdens weighing heavily on them, or they are shut-ins who just want to escape the world. And either way, nobody has much energy to do anything else. I noticed this before the pandemic but it's gotten worse now. Good luck finding someone that's interested in actually going out but wants to do anything besides smoke weed and drink, aka self-medicate, to have a prayer of numbing their misery for ten minutes.\n\nHumor reflects this, too. Probably half the things everyone I know finds knee-slapping hilarious are about wanting to die or working too much or struggling to make rent and buy food. If not, it's \"comedic\" political commentary that reinforces their views. And stuff that doesn't reinforce their views? Well, those people deserve to die. \n\nI'm not exaggerating either, and I'm not looking at any one side. Lines have been drawn and people have firmly chosen their sides.\n\nCollapse is also becoming mainstream at an alarming rate. The results of climate change or when stuff here in the USA is gonna reach a breaking point is normal conversation when it wasn't even 3 years ago.\n\nPeople are just so exhausted. Things in my town that were no big deal when I was a child are a huge production now. There aren't enough volunteers, enough funding, enough participants, enough anything. Yards are getting overgrown and looking crappy because no one has the time or energy to make them look nice anymore.\n\nI'm not saying I'm perfect, but I think the pandemic has just pushed so many over the edge. My situation really hasn't changed much so I don't think I have been as effected. But seeing this in so many other people both online and off is making *me* feel tired and hopeless.",

        "selftext": "any time the subject of switching to a renewable energy grid comes up the answer is ALWAYS \"but its so expensive! Who will pay for it?\"\n\nLets look at some of the things that, apparently, are NOT too expensive to pay for. \n\nThe most recent James Bond movie cost a total of $900M. Yes that is correct, **900 fucking million dollars!** \n\nhttps://movieweb.com/no-time-to-die-most-expensive-james-bond/\n\nLEts compare that to the largest solar energy plant ever built in the US \n\n>The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 802 megawatt (MWAC) solar photovoltaic power plant in Boulder City, Nevada, United States. The plant was developed by Sempra Generation. When the first unit of the facility entered service on December 1, 2010, it was the largest photovoltaic plant in the U.S. at 58 MW. [1] [2] [3] With the opening of Copper Mountain V in March 2021, it again became the largest in the United States.\n\nIt powers 80,000 homes with clean energy. \n\nCost for this plant? A paltry $141M. In other words for the cost of a James Bond movie we could build 6 of these things. SIX! \n\nThat enough to power 500,000 homes with clean renewable energy. But instead of building one of these every 6 months, we instead spend that money on James fucking Bond films. \n\nNow lets talk casinos. The Wynn casino in Vegas cost $2.7 Billion, with a \"B\".\n\nhttps://casino.partycasino.com/en/blog/the-most-expensive-casino-buildings/\n\n This is a monstrosity that has no right to exist at all, in the middle of the desert while the fresh water is disappearing. But somehow this asshole was able to snap his fingers and make $2.7B appear out of thin air for a shitty casino that does nothing but rip people off. \n\nFor that same price we could have built the equivalent of 19 copper mountain solar plant. Nineteen! That is enough to power 1.5 million homes! That is the size of the city of Philedelphia. \n\nSo we have plenty of money for movies and casinos but large scale solar renewable power plants? I guess we can only afford one of those a decade or so. \n\nThe point I am makin is that renewable energy is CHEAP. Its crazy inexpensive AND on top of that it staves off climate disaster, thus saving us all trillions of dollars. Its an absolute no brainer that we build a Copper Mountain every 3 months or so. But we still are not building out our renewable infrastructure. \n\nIts flat out insane. There is really no other word for it.",

        "selftext": "Honestly, I don't know why, but I've been feeling fucked up all morning. I just keep thinking about how fucked my future is and all of my friends futures are. Other than the people I know from HS that were already from rich families and had decent connections, most people I know are basically just fucked with nowhere to go. Sure, they don't acknowledge it frequently, but if you really prod that's what it is; wageslaves hitting our wall at the ripe old age of 22. \n\nMe? I don't even know what the fuck I'm to do. I'm 22, \"worthless\" degree (of course, all degrees are basically worthless and the only thing that truly matters is the connections you have), trying to get unemployment for the already shitty job I lost, struggling to find more pathetic retail wageslavery, starting to consider biting the bullet and just selling myself to Jeff Bezos so I can die working in a fucking Amazon wage cage. No clue when I'll be able to move out the house either, had my own place with roommates up where my college was, but my college closed, lease ran up, job shutdown. \n\nNo clue when/if I'll ever have another relationship with another person, too damned broke to honestly, like, no clue when I'll ever rent another apartment, and, hell, nobody would ever settle down with someone who's broke anyway. \n\nEvery day I'm terrified of what I'll do in the far future; even without bloody climate change the threat of homelessness in our \"normal\" society is bad enough. Honestly I feel the only thing that could have kept me sane was organizing politically, as a socialist, but then COVID showed up and basically made that impossible too; so now I'm hoping maybe I can try some community aid shit, but even then, I also need to find work to survive. \n\nMight even need to do a gap semester for college, and I'm worried if I do I'll never go back.\n\nSo, all that being said, I honestly feel like my future is totally fucked. I've read enough economic theory to understand that my future was basically fucked before I ever even went to college, honestly before I was ever even born. This meritocracy shite was always a lie; always, it was a lie for my parents' generation and for my generation they can't even keep up the facade. All they do is tell you how the kids I *know* were rich and well-connected beforehand worked hard, yeah, what a fuckin joke.\n\nHonestly, I see a lot of people my age sometimes fantasizing about war and things like that; and I think I get it now. It's like all those people right before WWI and II, all the poor as shit folks with no prospects and no future seeing the war as better than being poor as shit with nowhere to go; hell, at least it'd be an \"adventure\". \n\nMe, honestly, I'd rather die than be an Amazon wageslave, you ever see their patented idea of literally putting warehouse workers in cages? Ever seen their twisted anti-union training videos? This shit is beyond dystopian. I'd rather die in a war, preferably a revolutionary war, but, hell, any war really. I don't even think I'd survive a war, I'm pretty sure I'd die, but it's still better than a life of loneliness, wage slavery, and poverty. A life with no future. Hell, it's better than climate change.\n\nAnyone else my age feel this way? That there's just such a pervasive nothingness and boring dystopia that defines existence that dying in combat is better than living in chains?",

Whatever groundwater remains for native ecosystems, will get siphoned away so that the Joneses can grow their lawn, and mow it, over and over again.\n\nWhy is this a problem, it's only April right?  The \"wet season\" for the US west is basically over, so these droughts are literally only going to intensify for the next 8 months.  The vast majority of the water in the Southwest comes from Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountain snowpack.  Sierra Nevada's at [60% of normal.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/latest-snowpack-survey-in-sierra-nevada-shows-impact-of-this-years-dry-winter-on-california/ar-BB1fdDdm)   [60% in the Rocky's (](https://snowpack.water-data.com/uppercolorado/index.php)this is fine, enough to get corporations through another fiscal quarter!)\n\nAt this point, the US culture is literally a manifestation of a severe, and debilitating mental illness.  Godspeed, fellow psych ward patients.  The inmates are clearly running the global asylum.",

I thought you guys would just be talking about the best underground bunker designs and fantasizing about which guns would be best to fend off the marauding gangs of cannibals. I've seen several posts about promoting green policies and stuff like choosing to ride bikes everywhere. Some talk about buying EV's and then you have people who respectfully disagree with the dangers of strip mining metals necessary for the batteries. \n\nYou guys are just realistic and it's refreshing. Haven't seen any wild conspiracies or lunatics yet. Overall I think this is the best look and attitude to attract more people to your cause. It's more unifying than divisive.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: US is bankrupt. \n\nSo, everyone knows about what's happening with inflation. Everyone knows about the meme of \"money printer go brrrr\". The situation is more complicated than that, and if you pay attention, you'll begin to understand why I am drawing the conclusions I am. I'm making this post to summarize why this is happening, raise awareness, start a discussion, and inform people how it will affect their everyday lives. I'll keep it as simple as possible.\n\nIt all goes back to 2008. \n\n**2008**: This was the year the housing markets crashed due to irresponsible lending and overleveraging practices by the infamous big banks. Our government at the time chose to bail out the big banks, and   \n as such, the rich ruling class suffered minimal consequences for their actions. Meanwhile, this was the beginning of a trend in which the average person saw the steady decline in standard of living. This was the first time the Fed dropped interest rates as close to 0 as possible to save the economy.\n\n**2009 - 2016:** The economy reached a low, then began to recover, thanks to the eventual tech boom. Still, the average person didn't feel this in their everyday lives, except now they had facebook and amazon.\n\n**2016 - 2019:** We had attempted to raise interest rates back to normal levels, but the recovery was showing signs of slowing. This was because the normal market factors that influence growth rate were beginning to manifest - low wages, stagnant industries, etc. Because we didn't actually recover from 2008 - we were just saving the assets of the rich. \n\n**2020:** Pandemic begins. Another crash happens. Because the interest rates were already low, the only tools the fed had left by this point was to drop interest rates completely to 0 and initiate quantitative easing. Otherwise, the mother of all unraveling would have occurred in our economy.\n\nNow we arrive at the year **2022**. Inflation is running so hot, that the average person is noticing. If the rate at which prices are inflating continues, it will not be long before it upends all of society as people wont be able to afford food, or go to work. The ONLY tool remaining to solve this is to **raise interests rates** ***beyond*** **the rate of inflation.** The federal reserve yesterday made a press briefing. **They are not raising rates to necessary levels to cool inflation.**\n\nWhy?\n\n**The official reason**: The Fed claims that inflation is temporary due to supply chain issues, and due to Russia's conflict in Ukraine. They fear that increasing rates would cause an era of stagflation. This would be a legitimate concern, if it were not for the fact that the fed's predictions and projections seem completely inaccurate. Prices were inflating before Russia began it's war in Ukraine, and they predicted over a year ago that \"transitory\" Supply Chain related inflation would be resolved by now, despite being proven wrong. \n\n**The real reason:** The fed is between a rock and a hard place. If you take away anything from I'm writing, it should be this next paragraph. \n\nIf the fed raises rates significantly to combat inflation, it means the United States will become insolvent on its debt, and go bankrupt. It will also mean that asset markets collapse - houses, cars, stocks - all of it goes bye bye and the party of the rich is over. But if they don't raise rates and continue on as they're doing, WE THE CITIZENS are going to go bankrupt, and won't be able to fund the government, and then the government will go bankrupt anyway. And this is assuming there is no significant civil unrest that upends everything. \n\nYour way of life is over if that happens. And I don't even want to speculate on what else could follow. Tensions are at a high right now. Look at Jan 6th. Look at the summer riots previously. Whether you support or reject these movements or sentiments is irrelevant, you cannot deny social tensions are wearing thin. What is keeping peace and civility is that most people still have a stable and safe life, even if opportunity is declining and assets are inflating. If that goes away, our whole society will be in chaos. Imagine most people not being able to afford to drive their cars, grocery stores being empty or out of your price range, everyone stuck in these soulless unwalkable suburbs, with neighbors that hate each other.\n\nYou might at this point go: but aren't we a reserve currency? What does our debt even matter?\n\nRussia was cut off from SWIFT. Saudi's are considering buying oil in YUAN. Our debt doesn't matter because WE ARE the world reserve currency, and there are active interests abroad that don't want to see a US default, such as China. But if our dollar becomes worthless from printing, no one's going to want it. We'll be looking at the end of US dollar hegemony.\n\nAnd that will be the precise moment that 30T comes a knocking. And by that point you'll be wondering how to buy a loaf of bread that's 400$.",

Whether it's Twitter, Facebook or social media in general, there seems to be a growing consensus that something BIG is about to happen.\n\nClimate change is obviously in motion, but it also feels like a major shift in the global network of capital is happening very soon. In the United States alone, there appears to me to be a growing sense that the rampant income inequality, lack of affordable housing, and other symptoms of a failed capitalist state are simply not sustainable anymore and folks are starting to really grapple with that.\n\nThere are tweets and posts left and right across the internet that confirm this. Collective consciousness is a hell of a thing, and if this many people are starting to wake up to that, there's gotta be some truth to that.",

        "selftext": "My train of thought used to be this: The price of a house (at least in the US) is the maximum amount a family can expect to afford over the next 30 years. Wages have stagnated, so the price of a home cannot continue to rise. Therefore, the market is already at carrying capacity and the current price inflation--in the middle of a global pandemic, nonetheless--must be a bubble.\n\nYesterday I realized I'm completely wrong and we're in the middle of a paradigm shift. The new value of a home is calculated on the maximum annual rent extraction. The investment banks and the uber wealthy--bolstered by years of QE and pandemic hand outs--are using that wealth to buy the country and rent it back to us. After all, why should plebs build equity when a corporation can build that equity instead? And your monthly payment is the same, still \"affordable\" (i.e. half your income), it's now just a rent payment instead of a mortgage.\n\nIt's the same everything as a service models proliferating through our economy. Jobs as a service (e.g. the proliferation of \"contractors\"), entertainment as a service (e.g. Netflix), and now property as a service. We're in the middle of a regression to corporate serfdom.\n\n[In 2030 “You’ll own nothing” — And “you’ll be happy about it.”](https://medium.com/illumination/in-2030-youll-own-nothing-and-be-happy-about-it-abb2835bd3d1)\n\nSharing this for feedback/thoughts. Am I completely off base? What am I overlooking? Do you agree? Please let me know.\n\nP.S. I had no idea which subreddit to post this in, so I chose here.

But I'm saying this, because I've reached the point of despair where the longer I browse, and the more I think about it, the more it becomes apparent that we have no way out, our governments are going to do nothing to combat the ongoing collapse of our ecosystem, and everything is just going to spiral downwards.\n\nI'm saying that, I get it. But I also get that if I keep browsing here, and immersing myself in all of these thoughts of our futures, pretty soon I'm going to be staring down the neck of an empty pill bottle or a noose. I want to thank everyone here, for helping to open my eyes to what's coming, and for being so dedicated to spreading the message, but I'm tuning it out, because I'm resigned to the reality of how the world's governments are reacting to it, and I want to enjoy what time is left before things get, well, even worse.\n\nThank you, everyone, and I wish you all the best, but for my own mental health, I can't do this anymore.\n\nEdit: Aaaaaaand, the first reply is a downvote, if a mod sees this, if you could just hit that 'delete post' for me, that'd be great. I can see that this was a mistake, and I can't find that option on mobile. Thank you, and I'm deeply sorry for the hassle.",

Unrest, mass death, overwhelming fires, wars, and prolific disease are just SOME of the factors which will undeniably rise in the coming years. All of which will be greatly exacerbated by climate change, possibly to the point of extinction.\n\nHumans can smell fear. There’s a reason so many people are so terrified and anxious right now. Your instincts know things are about to get so much worse. Listen to them. Don’t let yourself get caught off guard, this is only the beginning.\n\nThe next decade is our last chance to end the capitalist system which has knowingly driven us into disaster. The consequences of fruitlessly attempting to preserve the status quo will never be recovered from. We must chose human survival first.

I am pretty sure that we are gonna witness many countries, in the following years, getting pulverized by intense weather phenomena. Scientists have spoken, we have been warned; Goverments should be taking measures already on how to save the world, there is no fucking time left. People should be in the streets demanding big corporations to stop destroying our world. Why no one seems to care about the wellbeing of the entire wolrd? But when things like the collapse of Afghanistan happens everyone seems to get emotional? Countries are sending help almost immediately , people are sending thoughts and prayers. \"Awww , we need to save those little Afghan bastards, talibans are so cruel\". You know who is more fucking cruel? Corporations that polute the oceans , rivers , lakes , our oxigen, expoilt children etc. etc.\n\nWe have been manipulated into thinking that our worst problem right now is Afghanistan, while the world is getting destroyed right in front of our eyes. When your house will be burned , be taken by a flood , destroyed by a hurricane, trust me , Afghanistan will be the least of your problem and countries wont be able to send any help because they will be dealing with their own collapse.\n\nThoughts and prayers to us all...\n\nEdit: Didn't expect my rant to get this popular.

They are totally unable to even get to work at this point because they were already on their last leg and literally are so far gone at this point they can't even work if they wanted to. Trigger alert.\n\nMaybe, just MAYBE we took some serious casualties in the area of unskilled labor in particular (the most vulnerable, exploited, uninsured, and underpaid class) in this most recent crisis and these workers aren't coming back because they have finally and totally fell through the cracks.\n\nLet me paint a picture for u.  There are layers and layers i have to get through to just get to work now, for the first time in my life I CANT GET TO WORK IF I WANTED TO FOR NOT JUST ONE OR TWO REASONS BUT SEVERAL.  I am personally living this now as i have no car to get to work.\n\nIf i had a car i wouldn't be able to drive it because i have a rare eye disease that requires special 2000 dollar (real price) contact lenses i cant afford and consequently cant renew my drivers license (HEALTHCARE).\n\nIf i did have a license and i car i soon will be homeless as my friend said fuck the grind and joined the army and is leaving for basic soon, something i ironically suggested he do (HOUSING).\n\nI have no credit, no car, no car or health insurance, no family, no where to live, no way to get to work, no cell phone, etc etc etc. Like i literally don't have a foundation to stand on (transportation, healthcare, money, family, etc) and i have been trying to figure out a way to get back to work and get healthcare and it has been a nightmare.\n\nALL THAT HELP U THINK IS THERE FOR HARDWORKING PEOPLE WHO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IS MADE UP.  ITS A FAIRY TALE.\n\nLet me let u in on a little secret.....  THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS U ASSUME ARE THERE IN THE BACK OF UR MIND, THE SAFETY NET POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT ON TV DOES NOT EXIST.  IT IS MADE UP.  NO ONE WILL HELP U.  FOOD STAMPS LAST THREE MONTHS, HEALTHCARE IS UNOBTAINABLE, HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION IS NOT PROVIDED FOR ANYONE.\n\nSUCCESS IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOT SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BORN FROM HARD WORK. U NEED A CAR TO GET TO WORK.  YOU NEED INSURANCE TO DRIVE THE CAR.  U NEED TO SEE IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE CAR.\n\nNo worries though boys I'm going to pull myself up by my boot straps and buy a car (cars, as well as housing, have never been more expensive, there is literally a car shortage right now jacking up prices) with my job i cant get to, using my eyes i cant see out of.....\n\nI will figure it out like i have always done as i have lacked the courage to do the only logical and practical thing so far.  While i am clearly struggling and am consequently biased, I'm looking at my own life and I'm seeing this worker shortage and it makes me wonder if their isn't more people who are in my position who want to work but cant.  I'm trying to get help from these limp dick do nothing government programs that we have gutted the past 50 years and i LITERALLY cant get back on my feet- its pretty clear to me these people are all gone at this point.  THE GOV WONT GIVE U ANY GOV ASSISTANCE UNLESS U ARE ALREADY ON GOV ASSISTANCE (their words not mine).  THEY WONT GIVE ME A CELL PHONE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON FOOD STAMPS (THEY EXPIRED).\n\nThis is something well to do people in this country cant seem to wrap their heads around because the difference between upper class and lower class, healthy families and dysfunctional is so vast that people don't understand that at this point hard work is the last virtue that is important when u are making 600 dollars on a paycheck doing overtime.

        "selftext": "Anyone who has paid any attention to how the media covers police murders knows very well the power that the passive voice has in laundering the reputation of the police. People are finally starting to catch on to terms like \"police involved shooting\", or the habit of describing a police officer's firearm as a semi-sentient being that \"discharges\" into the back of a person fleeing rather than being the conscious decision of a cop to kill.\n\nThe same thing happens around \"climate change\" discourse, though less obviously. Of course, \"climate change\" is one of many different ways of describing what is happening in the world, and as a descriptor of what is happening in the biosphere it is of course a pretty good one; however, you always sacrifice a facet of the real world with language and I'd argue that the term \"climate change\" sacrifices a lot. \"Global Warming\" is even less accurate, and \"Anthropocene\" is the worst of all; first, because it doesn't carry any dire connotations on its own, and second, because it attributes to a vague and ahistorical concept like human nature something that is only a very recent phenomenon, which not so coincidentally coincided with the introduction of the steam engine.\n\nThese observations won't be new to anyone who has been following these issues for a while, but it nonetheless needs to be reiterated: What you call something has huge political implications. You can inadvertently obscure, bury the lede, or carry water for the powerful interests destroying our planet, or you can pierce to the root of a problem in the way you name something, and even rouse people to further criticism and ultimately to action.\n\nI would argue that the most incisive, most disruptive term we can use to describe this moment is \"the capitalist destruction of nature.\" Put the metaphorical cop behind the gun. Implicate the real agent, rather than \"the world,\" or \"humanity\", or some other fiction. \n\nNow, obviously the media isn't going to start saying this. The term probably won't enter the popular discourse, even among the \"woke\" upwardly mobile urban professional classes who are finally starting to learn about racism (albeit filtered through a preening corporate backdrop). It's not the job of that level of culture to pierce ideological veils, but rather to create them. They're never going to tell the truth, but we do know the truth, so lets start naming it.",

Then after realizing what is the path ahead I went through all the stages of grief to finally settle in a good status quo of work-hobby-preps-family. \n\nThen the pandemic happened and I couldn't be happier. Of course, I was not happy that people died or businesses were destroyed. I tried to help as much as possible by buying locally, lending money or helping ppl on quarantines.  I was just happy that we consumed, grinded, travelled less. Finally, there was something that was indisputable and we knew our trajectory, at last I could grasp at something that was set in stone and it was my pillar. Instead of working a brain-dead job, going for \"drinks with the boss\", coming home tired I could finally work from home, work more on my garden, spend more time with my family, read books, workout, write articles. \n\nI was prepared for a long time and this pandemic state of things was is some sort appeasing. \n\nBut... now with the hopium vaccine (I don't want to discuss if it is a good vaccine, or a bad one etc) everyone around me is cheerful. I can already see my boss setting up \"come-back\" meetings, I can already see the consumption ramping up (look at AMC, airbus, boeing stocks today) or how my friends can't wait to buy plane tickets to Vietnam or Australia.\n\nThe \"back to normal\" should be called \"back to killing the planet\". I think that the consumption during the first months after the introduction of the vaccine will be doubled. Imagine all those college fratboys, all these companies, all those businessmen spending even more money on useless things because for the last year they were unhappy \"depressed\" and were not able to spend.\n\nSorry for my rant but people will never learn. I hoped for at least 3-4 years of covid19 tranquility and reduced pollution. How silly I am.\n\nEdit. Thank you all for your support. It's reassuring that I'm not alone in this.",

I still try to practice some sustainable habits and combat climate change in whatever small ways I’m able.\n\nMy question though, is why do we see everywhere these people who have children they obviously love so very deeply, many of them not at all stupid or ignorant, who just seem to completely ignore the fact that the world their children will inherit will look nothing like the one they’re currently living in? They don’t practice sustainability, they pass down consumerist habits to their kids, and they don’t talk about preparing their kids for anything that may come. Why is this, do you think?\n\nEdit: I’ll get to responding to people as soon as I can, but I just wanna say a couple things to clarify…\n\n1) I’m not completely anti-natalist, and I’m not a misanthrope. I understand where these people are coming from, but some of y’all in the comments are showing deep hatred for people with kids. I don’t think that’ll get us anywhere.\n\n2) I don’t mean for this to come across as fact. It’s not. It’s not universally true by any means, and it’s totally just based on my own experiences.

        "selftext": "If we could pinpoint an exact date of when societal degradation and collapse began, it would be the election of President Reagan in 1980. His leadership and presidency mobilized the religious right, birthed Reaganomics (extremely unregulated market). His presidency also kickstarted police militarization, and was very anti worker’s rights. Reagan’s legacy was so influential it shifted the entire American political spectrum right. The precedents set in his administration would lead to the many disasters Americans and the rest of the world face today. Firstly, Reagan’s presidency assured a Bush Sr. Presidency (his VP) which would also eventually lead to a Bush Jr. Presidency, where his tenure saw the beginning of the surveillance and police state we see today. The Bush years also started the mess of American foreign entanglement (Iraq, drone program, Afghanistan.) In short, Reagan’s ultraconservative economic and social policies gave us the corporatism that dominates American politics and everyday life today. Big business comes first. Everything must be profitable, even healthcare. He was anti science, anti peace, and pro imperialism. Reagan also indirectly continued the suffering of American minorities through the War on Drugs, which can be seen now in the mass incarceration and systemic racism we have today. While it may seem like a long shot to place all societal ills on one election, it would indirectly lead to all of the major problems of today. Every president to come after Reagan, even Democrats, continued the laissez-faire economic system which has destroyed economic freedom, led to extreme wealth inequality, and accelerated the climate crisis. Last note, Reagan would also be the president to legitimize and empower the far-right we deal with today.\n\n\n\nedit: there are many more heinous things Reagan did that i forgot to add, such as destroying unions, obliterating healthcare for the mentally ill, funding terrorist groups (Al Qaeda, Contras), and so much more.",

This is blatantly the case with Apple products, as they will install a new update that renders the device useless after 3-5 generations of Iphones. It is also the case with cars and other technical devices. There are two big problems with that as far as I can see.\n\n\\- It is unfair. We \"lower-class folks\" have to spend more money on basically everything just because some rich people want to have more than they already have (and frankly, don't need). It's noteworthy that it is more than possible to create dependable and durable products, but only the rich will have access to them (or they don't need to because they can afford it anyway).\n\n\\- It is going to destroy the planet. With billions of cars (in particular, because they are relatively big vehicles that the average person can own), computers and phones being produced, it is natural to expect earth's resources to run out some time in the near future. If cars were only manufactured when they had to be replaced because of accidents and so on, it would make a gigantic difference.\n\nThe rich either don't care if it's going to destroy the planet or they are so incredibly delusional that they don't comprehend it. Something has to be done about this, sadly I don't have the slightest idea as to what that could be. The obvious thing to realize is that the current system needs to change dramatically, however it is built by the rich for the rich, so it's going to be hard for us normal people to change it.",

        "selftext": "***TL;DR:*** **The US will not be in conventional war with itself. If anything, it is going to Balkanize. It will be ugly and not a good time.**\n\nFew people want to read books on reddit so I am going to keep this one short(er). If you want the long version, I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/m1duoa/the_united_states_is_following_a_pattern_of/)^1 [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj18x4/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^2 [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj1al6/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^3 If you don't like reading, Robert Evans' podcast \"It Could Happen Here\" is a good introduction to these concepts. All sources are linked at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, the term \"civil war\" has been in mainstream new cycle as of late. Of course many people balk at this idea because they cannot imagine this happening. It must be impossible in today's modern world with all its complexities. The problem is that those people still view \"war\" in the way it happened in the 1940s: two big sides, attacks and counter-attacks over lines on a map, money and fuel and infantry on the ground trying to outlast each other, etc. It doesn't work like that. War hasn't worked like that for at least the past 50 years.\n\nThe signs of a coming civil collapse can be watered down to four indicators:\n\n**1. Freedom and rights are disappearing.**\n\nThe two wings of our neoliberal political system have refused to return liberties to common people and have only intensified their assault on the unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Healthcare, the right to one's own body, a living wage allowing one to own a house.\n\n**2. Polarization, hate, and violence are on the rise.**\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign started on January 20, 2021 at 12:00. [White supremacy is now mainstream.](http://archive.vn/INs2W)^4\n\n**3. Access to information is limited.**\n\nAn information silo is a business management term for information that is self-contained and walled off from everything else. I'm not getting into business jargon here, so think of it like a grain silo. Yes, that giant tube with a dome on top next to a barn. It's full of grain and on the top you can even stand on it (don't do that). It looks good, sturdy, stable, just like a new theory you are exposed to. But if you start poking around, there are a lot of holes, cavities, voids. If one of those collapses, then you go down. You go down and you're done. Just like that. Or maybe you get chest deep, but then you're still stuck. All of the grain, the little bits of theory, the information is so much pressure on you that can't get out. You can't pull yourself out and people can see you but they can't really help either. If you are thrown a rope and enough people try, then may they pull you out. However, the forces of grain on your body may crush you anyway in the process. The way out takes professional help; someone with the proper tools to build blockers around you, so that the pressure is gone and they can safely move you out.\n\nWe have tens of millions of the US population living in alternates realities. These thousands of grains of conspiracy theories and actual foreign propaganda are stuck together through lies and gaslighting, or what is now cutely called \"misinformation\". It has become profitable to keep people in these information silos. [Reddit is about to IPO.](http://archive.vn/Hmoc5)^5 That means that like Facebook and YouTube, it will be flooded with \"fact checkers\" and censures and guidance to keep what is on it appropriate for capital inventors and advertisers.\n\n**4. The behavior of people in the know.**\n\nThis is what people are noticing now. People who study extremism saw the writing on the wall at end of 2020. The rest of the country saw it in January 2021. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took action after the 6th to mitigate the risks of a further self-coup. He even [put out a memo on Jan 12th stating his actions.](http://archive.vn/YFzrL)^6 The people paying attention are [seeing the pattern for what it is.](http://archive.vn/CLaep)^7\n\n---\n\n## Americanisms\n\nThe US will be facing a constitutional crisis. We witnessed a practice violent coup on Jan 6. In a different century, when another angry charismatic man did this, he was barely punished at all and then returned 10 years later with a successful political coup. The political coup is going on right now, in the states of Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona. If the results of the primaries go a certain way, that movement will be re-energized. The coup has not failed yet. It has not stopped.\n\nThe US has already fulfilled the 14 points of a certain mode of government. That's old news. The ~~Sturmabteilung~~ Proud Boys (even in their neutered state), the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers have no shortage of [able-bodied, reactionary men.](http://archive.vn/0CoEw)^8 \n\nThe US is heavily divided through manufactured hatred. It is the tried and true method of divide-and-conquer used to kill a nation. The Germans did it to Namibia. The Dutch did it to South Africa. The Belgians did it to Rwanda. The Brits did it to Afghanistan. Reagan funded it in Yugoslavia. And now it's happening here.\n\nIn the scenario that things become kinetic, it is not going to end fast. Every enemy nation and their dog will be doing their damnest to keep the USA in conflict and de-stabilized for as long as possible. And every country that is not an open enemy will be doing their damnest to direct proxy battles and make sure that the power vacuum does not re-fill in the wrong way. There are thousands of reasons to be worried about the most powerful arsenal in human history. The US is far bigger than Germany or Yugoslavia. When it falls, the entire world will suffer.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Awful Takes\n\n> It won't happen because no one really wants it to.\n\nThe majority of people never want to go to war with their neighbors. Yet history has shown us that all it takes is an extreme vocal minority and a pathetic majority for these things to happen. And when it does happen, people who really don't want to choose are forced to choose. \n\n> Will it be a declared war or an undeclared war?\n\nIt is guerrilla warfare with a growing police state. No opposing forces are going to announce themselves to the public and arrange in neat battle positions.\n\n> The police will protect us.\n\nHistorically, cops protect right-wing militias, join right-wing militias, and/or operate as their own ad hoc force in service to whatever charismatic figure promises \"law and order\". Police are people and they will protect their own families before they protect yours.\n\n> My favorite governor/senator/millionaire will protect us.\n\nThey will be in their wealthy enclave with their private security forces or in their retreat in New Zealand, or Alaska, or with their money in Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, or the Cayman Islands.\n\n> We'll just run away to Canada/Mexico. \n\nAmerican refugees from climate crises (just within the country) are already predicted to be tens of millions. If things turn kinetic, multiply that by 3. Illegal immigration is not suddenly okay when you try to do it. If your next plan is to hide out in the woods, that's the same plan as a million other people.\n\n> The military will stop it immediately.\n\nFirst, the military is an apolitical institution. The best scenario is that they don't do anything and remain an institution, ensuring their legitimacy. Second, [soldiers are not apolitical.](http://archive.vn/1CSrN)^9 If a Myanmar scenario occurs, they are likely to fracture when they have to start kicking in doors and bombing population centers that look like their own. That's an increase in militia forces. The upper brass has their own leanings as well. Third, it took about 25,000 soldiers to lock down a square mile of DC for a month after Jan 6. Do the math. The USA is too big for the military to effectively subdue a warring population.\n\n> Civilians aren't armed enough to fight the military!\n\nThere are over 400 million guns in this country and a population of about 330 million. And military firearms, actual assault rifles, [go missing all the time.](http://archive.vn/OOZyi)^10 [So do the explosives.](http://archive.vn/7lZdf)^11\n\n> Rednecks with guns can't stop drones!\n\nDrones and tanks exist to perform specific tasks. They are excellent in the conventional format of war between nations. They're not so great against a guerrilla force of maybe 50 million+. A drone can't hold a street corner. Tanks are only as good as their supply chain of fuel. Like we saw in Afghanistan, and what Ethiopia is seeing against Tigray right now; even with all of your fancy weapon systems and national backers, if you are massively outnumbered in asymmetrical warfare then it is just a matter of time. Besides, while a drone pilot may operate out of a secure bunker in Hawaii, they have a family that lives in a city or town like everyone else. It's a dark thing to think about.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n1. cybil\\_92. “The United States Is Following a Pattern of Collapse That Leads to Civil War.” _R/Collapse_, 9 Mar. 2021, https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/m1duoa/the_united_states_is_following_a_pattern_of/.\n\n2. cybil\\_92. “An Examination of Modern Conflict (An Analysis of the USA’s Pattern of Collapse That Leads to Civil War) Part 1 of 2.” _R/Collapse_, 12 July 2021, https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj18x4/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/.\n\n3. cybil\\_92. “An Examination of Modern Conflict (An Analysis of the USA’s Pattern of Collapse That Leads to Civil War) Part 2 of 2.” _R/Collapse_, 12 July 2021, https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj1al6/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/.\n\n\n4. “White Nationalists Celebrate As More Republicans Parrot Their Rhetoric.” _Angry White Men_, 18 Dec. 2021, http://archive.vn/INs2W.\n\n5. “Reddit Confidentially Files to Go Public.” _Reuters_, 16 Dec. 2021, http://archive.vn/Hmoc5.\n\n6.

        "selftext": "I keep hearing this myth repeated that Redditors lean young and progressive and that Reddit is a left-leaning website. I'm not American but if this is true relative to the United States, then we're so incredibly fucked. I would argue that most opinion-having Redditors tend to represent the apathetic centre here in Canada. \n\nThe comments I see from average people on here have made me really tune into how reactionary even people who claim to be on the left are. The only spaces you can find people that aren't obstacles to progress are in niche subreddits dedicated to not being that. \n\nI'm deeply concerned about climate change, but even when I couch my climate change stances and add so much context that I think any reasonable person would be on board... I get attacked, I get nasty PMs, and every comment in response falls into either the climate denial bucket or into the one adjacent to that, the \"there's no hurry, the free market will sort it out and no, we don't have to change our lifestyles, stop being dramatic\" bucket (is there a difference?)\n\nIf Reddit is representative of the general public in western countries, we're fucked. If it's left of the general public, we're even more fucked. Even the most milquetoast solutions get shot down by any number of people from any number of political backgrounds here. Anything that represents a departure from full tilt collapse is seen as too radical, too unworkable and \"you don't understand basic economics\". \n\nToxic individualism and rabid consumerism, byproducts of the Neoliberal era, have destroyed our society's immune system by destroying our ability to organize and even have basic empathy for others. We couldn't fight Covid-19 without throwing entire segments of the population under the bus and most people don't even feel bad that we did as long as they weren't personally affected. \n\nNot only can we not fight climate change, even the best response people would accept is still woefully insufficient. It even falls short of the current Paris Agreement, which itself is insufficient. The best we can come up with is Biden or Trudeau-like figures and policies. \n\nEvery conversation I get into about the subject on the internet goes as follows:\n\n\"We should change our economic system and individual behaviours but in a way that is fair and equitable.\" \n\n\"How DARE you tell ME to change MY behaviour! You're INFRINGING upon my GOD GIVEN rights! If I want to guzzle gasoline and eat food from all corners of the globe every day, that's my RIGHT!\" \n\nWe can't sustain effective grassroots movements either because most people in them have selfish motives, which is part and parcel of the aforementioned toxic individualism. If social media didn't exist, the #BLM protests last year would have been way smaller with far fewer non-black people because what's the point of caring about something if no one can see you do it? Same goes for everything else. Our response to everything is performative and lacking in substance. \n\nAt a point in history when we need a lot of people willing to die for these causes, everyone puts themselves first, myself included (I'm working on it but at least I'm aware of this). Major systemic change can only happen when people are willing to die for the cause and this is true of all historical movements we still talk about today. The labour movement, the Civil Rights movement, Women's Suffrage, you name it. If people are taking selfies or streaming themselves at a protest instead of being radical at one, they don't really care that much. \n\nManhattan or big chunks of some coastal region in North America could (will) go under water because of climate change and I bet even **that** won't be enough to spurn real collective action that isn't full of performative LARPing and people finally conceding that \"the free market will fix it on its own with innovation\". \n\n\"Maybe based Uncle Elon will think of something! *HURRRRR FUCKING DURRRRR*\" \\*bangs head on keyboard until dead*\n\nWe're so fucked. We're no different than hedonistic Romans a few millennia ago, partying while their civilization collapsed. We only pretend to care because we feel the need to.\n\nGood luck rest of the world, you're going to need it.\n\n**Edit**: thanks for the awards and understanding, wasn't expecting it to blow up like this. Yes, I am quite angry about this stuff and have been for awhile. I think we should all be more angry.\n\n**Edit**: Gold, awesome! I'll match it with a donation.",

We talk about collapse in popular culture and many more people are becoming \"collapse aware\".  But we continue on like everything is perfectly normal. I understand we need to perform basic tasks in order to pay our bills. We need to pay rent and eat because we're already here.  But it seems like everyone thinks that collapse is survivable for most people. They might stock up on some extra food and water...but they haven't seemed to consider the serious and wider implications of collapse. Their generator or canned food or extra medical supplies would tide them over for a few weeks or months, but it probably won't get them through their lifespan.\n\nIf global society collapses by 2050 everyone who is my age is f\\*cked.  I'm 23.  I'm barely making enough to pay my own bills. I try to set aside some canned food every now and then, but I can't afford to prepare to survive collapse...collapse that seems more inevitable with each day we live through. I'm 23.  If society collapses by 2040 I'll be 41.  If these predictive models are right no one my age or younger has a future.  I'm angry.  The people who came before us doomed my generation to a lifetime of suffering, and no amount of prepping will save most of us.   I'm tired of feeling like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat when I have these conversations with my peers. Most of my friends either think we'll ride this out or have completely given up on caring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just want to say that when I say I'm angry at the generations that came before I don't mean I'm angry at regular people who were just trying to get by, unaware of the consequences of capitalism and overconsumption. I'm angry at the leaders of corporations that looked at climate change data that was presented to them and went \"hm, ok we can deal with that later\".  I'm angry at the government leaders that ignored epidemiologists who tried to warn governments about the increased likelihood of new pandemics BEFORE COVID happened.  TL;DR I'm angry at the leaders who *were* aware of the consequences and willfully chose to do nothing. You should be angry at them too.\n\nAlso, to folks telling me to get more involved in the community and learn adaptable skills, I'm already involved. I'm not posting here as an entitled person yelling from the sidelines. I'm a nursing grad student who has worked through the pandemic. I volunteer and I garden. I read books and watch videos  and participate in continuing education.",

I've spoken to many foreign nationals in person or through the internet and I'm disgusted by how wasteful the western consumer culture is and how much more it contributes to destruction of our environment (and eventual collapse) despite having a greater share of global wealth. \n\nFrugal living is part of our culture. When something breaks down, we repair it and the means to it is often as simple as walking to a specialized repair shop nearby: a pot that has lost its teflon layer can be repaired or repurposed, home appliance repair shops are always nearby (many are repaired using parts locally produced), cars (they live into their 50s if properly managed and the second hand car market is very thriving), clothing and shoes can be repaired (many at home), furniture, mobile phones, computers etc.\n\nIt's not just that our economy is under heavy pressure and we can't but new stuff. We can locally produce many of these stuff  at affordable prices (from cars to electronic devices). But people generally don't buy new stuff when old ones can still be used or repaired. We find it to be wasteful to replace stuff until absolutely necessary. Used stuff can also be traded or given away through many means: there are shops that only sell second hand stuff, wandering buyers in pickup trucks that frequent city streets buying second hand stuff and recyclable material (metals, paper, clothing, plastics and etc) and there are applications that are very popular for trading second hand stuff.\n\nIt is my understanding that in many first world countries, often people just replace stuff when it's broken instead of repairing it, as the economy does not prioritize repairing and reusing (both culturally and politically). Some of my acquittances were shocked when I showed them how we repair home appliances (*why not return them and buy a new one?*) Please correct me If I'm wrong, and provide your experience when trying to repair or reuse a broken item.",

        "selftext": "A big reason I like this sub is it’s observance of the real time decline of civilization from the effects of climate change and capitalism, but without usually devolving into the “humans bad” or “people are parasites” takes. But lately I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about “overpopulation” in a way that resembles reactionary-right talking points, and many people saying that we as a species have it coming to us. \n\nClimate change is a fault and consequence of capitalism and the need to serve and maintain the power of the elite. Corporations intentionally withheld information about climate change in order to keep the public from knowing about it or the government from taking any action. Even now, they’ve done everything from lobbying to these PSA’s putting the responsibility of ending climate disaster in individual people and not the companies that contribute up to 70% of all emissions. The vast majority of the human race cannot be blamed for the shit we’re in, especially when so much brainwashing is used under neoliberalism to keep people in line. \n\nIf you’re concerned with the fate of the earth and our ability to adapt to it, stop blaming our species and look to the direct cause of it all- capitalist economies in western nations and the elite who use any cutthroat strategies they can to keep their dynasties alive.\n\n**EDIT:** For anyone interested, here’s a [study showing that the wealthiest 10% produce double the emissions of the poorest half of the population](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/carbon-emissions-richest-1-percent-more-double-emissions-poorest-half-humanity).\n\n**ANOTHER EDIT:** I’m seeing a lot of people bring up consumption as an issue tied to overpopulation. Yes, overconsumption is an issue, [one which can be traced to capitalism](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thenews.com.pk/amp/537570-capitalism-and-consumption) and its need for excessive and unsustainable growth. The scale of ecological destruction we’re seeing [largely originated in the early industrial period](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/the-industrial-revolution-kick-started-global-warming-much-earlier-than-we-realised-64301), which was also *the birth of capitalist economies and excessive industrialization*; climate change and pollution is a consequence of capitalism, which is inherently [wasteful and destructive](https://www.google.com/amp/s/truthout.org/articles/capitalist-economies-create-waste-not-social-value/%3famp). Excessive economic growth requires excessive population growth, and **while I’m not denying the catastrophes that would arise from overpopulation, it is not the root of the disaster set before us**. If you’re concerned about reducing consumption and keeping the population from booming, then you should be concerned with the ways capitalist economies require it.\n\n**ANOTHER EDIT AGAIN:** If people want any evidence that socialism would help stabilize the population, [here’s a fun study I found](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12313935/) through a quick internet search. If you want to read more about Marxist theory regarding population and food distribution, among other related things, [this is useful and answers a lot of questions people may have](https://www.marxists.org/archive/bebel/1879/society-future/ch10.htm).\n\ntl;dr climate change, over-consumption, and any possible threat posed by over-population all mostly originate in capitalism and are made exceedingly worse through it.",

This means using hundreds of gallons of water per lawn owner per year. And what are they using this water for? To make their grass grow quicker. Why do they want their grass to grow quicker? So they can cut it back down...\n\nWhy does this make sense to anyone but golf courses? Why do millions if not over a billion people perpetually cultivate and destroy the plantlife they're growing? The ones I'm talking about, the HOA regulators and lawn hobbyists, they don't come close to needing it for anything other than cosmetic reasons.\n\nSo what this means is that people pour hours and hours of time into making something look pretty. This pretty thing costs us multiple billions of gallons of water every year, and is excuse for people to pump thousands of gallons of CO2 into the air. Nothing benefits from mowing, in fact it only serves to harm other wildlife (when you mow over that patch of dandelions the bee who wanted that pollen has a tougher time). The only reason I can think of other than \"it looks pretty\" would be to prevent things sneaking around (rodents, rabbits, raccoons, snipers) but even that is stretching it in the terms of \"reasoning\".\n\nNow it's not like you can convince anyone to stop tending their lawn, idk why but it seems to be some weird of status necessity to perpetually have green, short, grass, but it seems like the most counter productive and counter intuitive thing on the planet, yet you will get shit for not enjoying it.\n\nIf you don't like to mow or tend to lawns you're weird, people treat you like a lazy freak and won't listen to your logic as to why. So keep it in mind, something like mowing the lawn: which is nothing but making yourself work and waste resources for no benefit other than \"now other people will think I'm normal\": is so expected of you that you're treated unkindly if you don't like it.\n\nNow try to think about how much all the other bullshit in our daily lives are only there because if we don't do them other people will look at us funny. That is the majority of the USA right now, to quote Rush \"Conform or be cast out.\" A mindset that is shared by both the left and the right. \n\nOn the left you're not allowed to encourage anything that isn't beneficial to society, nature, or the future. On the right you're not supposed to do anything that wastes your time without a profitable result, or to value any kind of beauty over function. Yet I bet both still mow their fucking lawns.",

        "selftext": "So, I was talking to someone who I am acquainted with, and the topic of the economy came up midway in our conversation.  The guy wanted to know what my opinion was on how everything was going in this country. So, I pretty much said that its all looking like a mess to me.  That we're pretty much printing off trillions of dollars like as if it's no big deal and that it will really mess us up in the end.  I basically was saying that you just can't print off nearly $10 trillion dollars in the span of less than 3 years and expect there to be no repercussions.  I then said that we will soon see it where, making 50,000 or 60,000 a year will not be able to purchase you much of anything in this country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext thing you know the guy made me jump because his voice was raised, and he was yelling at me for suggesting that sooner or later a mid 5 figure salary will mean nothing.  I mean I understand that money is a touchy issue for a lot of people, but it's like why ask if you didn't want me to give my honest assessment.  I mean you don't need a degree in economics to see just how worthless your money is becoming as the days go by.  I mean when I recently took a trip to the grocery store, I no longer am buying beef due to it costing just as much as a lobster tail is these days and the same can be said about chicken.  I have been living very frugally and have been having to cut out a lot of my usual wants due to inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen you have the topic of housing.  It used to be the case that NYC and San Francisco was the only super expensive cities to watch out for in this country.  But nowadays Atlanta, GA is starting to join them as their real estate and rent has skyrocketed since the pandemic not to mention other southern states like texas and florida.  Getting a house in the south is now starting to get as expensive as the north is soon enough.  I mean overall, though people really seem to be getting hyper aggressive and agitated when you're just stating that we're likely due for some extremely bad inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, though I feel a little antsy now whenever someone brings up the topic of the economy and is making me consider just changing the topic whenever they do so.  For the most part, as far as I am concerned, you would have to be delusional if you think that your money is still as valuable as 2019 and prior.\n\nEdit:  This came to me as a surprise to see how many likes and comments that I have received on this post.  Thank you all for sharing your experiences and it is nice, reading all of your comments.",

        "selftext": "The problem is **inter network conformity.**  What is inter network conformity? It is the conformity of individuals to group mechanisms on  intertwined networks (the internet). \n\nThis process has numerous consequences, extreme emotional behaviour, conforming to misinformation, and it has also played a role in terrorism and civil wars. We have seen the consequences past decade, and that was the first decade of badly moderated social media with real identies. It's not going to get better , it's going to get worse, these consequences have become more prevalent and more frequent.\n\nI'm glad the problem has reached pop culture through a movie like don't look up, and that's good, but while the movie portrays the consequence of misinformation  perfectly it doesn't explain why a lot of people behave like this. I've seen people compare it with the movie idiocracy, but the fact is people aren't that stupid, they are just brainwashed.\n\nThere are 5 pillars why this is happening. **1.** Group conformation mechanics **2.** spreading power through internet  technology, **3.** propaganda mechanics, **4**. lack of filter when communicating  online and **5.** real identity online.\n\n**1) group conformation mechanics**  which are proven by milgram and asch. These experiments proved that  groups  will make people comply with false or unethical information, with or without  direct social pressure.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram\\_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch\\_conformity\\_experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments)\n\n**2)** The mechanics above combined with max **spreading power**.  Normally conformation is a  advantage for an individual, since the group strengthens the individual, but the failsafes  don't work on digital intertwined networks since it no longer bound by space and time. Here the conformity mechanism stays active all the time, and everywhere, and can no longer be altered when needed since it there is a constant influx of new group members, unaware that the group they're joining is conforming around misinformation.\n\n**3)** Effectiveness of propaganda in **mass information**.  As proven by nobelprizewinner Herbert A. simon.  Misinformation isn't  necessarily propaganda, but when it gets enough coverage through group  conformation mechanics , it has the same effect. When there is a flood  of information, propaganda is a lot more effective, because people  simplify information, propaganda is simple information and by that  easily conformed and believed.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion\\_in\\_Social\\_psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda#Persuasion_in_Social_psychology)\n\n**4)** **Lack of filter when communicating**,  communicating through text and video doesn't have the same failsafes as  communicating in person, there is less filter, filter that is needed.  These unfiltered emotions,  these gut feelings  are posted online and sometimes become groups.  It's also one of the reasons why every emotion is so exaggerated.\n\n**5)** **Real identity:**  The group conformation mechanics are maximized not only through  spreading power, effectiveness of propaganda in mass information, and  the lack of filter when communicating, but the real identity online makes this all  very real, forcing you to conform, since the group knows who you are.\n\n**Conclusion:** people are brainwashed, and there's nobody brainwashing them,  they are brainwashing themselves through their subconsciousness and this  technology. \n\nThe  perfect example is antivaxxers. Climate change deniers as well, but to a  lesser extent (as an example),  vaccination technology is 70 year old  tech and polio did happen.",

        "selftext": "Hey all, first post here and I'm not sure if it fits. Mods feel free to remove if I'm mistaken. \n\nSo many of today’s politics are conflicted with double standards. Everyone praises the “leader” who can also wear the hat of “job creator”, as if creating multitudes of meaningless and menial “jobs” is enough to get a pat on the back. They also get praise for keeping said “jobs” in the US, like that’s some sort of gold standard, when in reality it goes against all of their other capitalist values. Why should we work to keep jobs in America when the natural flow of the market decides that outsourcing jobs where they’re more valued by the people who have them is what needs to happen?  Why do they preach the merits of laissez-faire economics and “allowing the market to decide” when they so clearly go against that? It’s hindering our society in so many ridiculous ways. So ridiculous that this system needs to be changed. \n\nI propose we do exactly as they say they want for once, we should “laissez-faire” with a vengeance, let all the jobs naturally diffuse where they may and let automation take over the rest. Instead of constantly fighting with the system we made and patching its gaping holes, we should finally allow it to reach its inevitable equilibrium and work in tune with it. We’re struggling against yet another one of our created systems, when we have the ability to change exactly how it works. All of this nonsense is human generated, so it can also be radically torn down and rebuilt by humans as well. When the far out-dated “blue collar jobs” are all replaced by robotic arms, machine learning, and computer vision, only specialized work will be truly valued. I believe this will encourage the influx of a generation of people born to think and challenge the way things are, the real “job creators”, who do what we Americans so often claim we are “the best at”. They’ll be the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the ones to drag the slow human race kicking and screaming to the stars. \n\nI know some of you are already thinking about what happens to the blue collars who are too old to learn anything new and just want to retire, well that’s what the magical idea of a Universal Basic Income is all about. People who are being phased out by automation have to make a living somehow and the factory owners with all the robots aren’t paying anyone for the blue collar jobs anymore. A portion of that increased revenue can go to taxes to fund the people who lost their jobs. The people who have now gained the freedom to express themselves in ways they couldn’t imagine when they were chained to their menial 8 hour day jobs. They can be free to find a purpose \\*worth\\* pursuing, not just try to stay alive and keep their family fed. Is the idea of a social safety net really too far out there? We have the capacity to make sure that no child in the world goes unfed, no mother goes homeless, and no father breaks his back, but we choose to avoid this time and again. \n\nIt’s ridiculous that our economy has become this death cult centered around working just for the sake of working and making a few people just that much richer. Arguing against automation or artificially slowing its advance when we have the technology is beyond asinine and encourages workplace injuries for our equally asinine healthcare system to take care of. Plus it makes people just that much more depressed with their lives. You’ve all seen/experienced working from home during this pandemic right? You’ve seen all the people saying, “Wait, I actually like this. Can we work from home more often?” That’s because people are actually happy for once. They were in charge of their own time with no manager or boss breathing down their neck, just a task to finish at their own pace. No commuting to burn the planet down, less waste to hasten that effect, and a more energy efficient society was created, fleeting as it may be. \n\nWe shouldn’t look at UBI like the politicians would want us to, like extra “welfare” designed to have more people draining the system for themselves. That’s the narrative of a few they push so they can save all the money for the corporations guilty of exactly that. Think of it as subsidizing the people so they are free to do as they want. We could guarantee so many things as human rights and make so much progress in the process. An injury could finally not mean a death sentence, be it financial or literal. A missed utility bill could be a thing of the past when utilities are all guaranteed. Starvation wages could be starved out themselves. A college degree could be more than just a paper worth five or six cars. People could finally follow their passions and create a healthier, more fulfilling society because of it. Maybe this might be taking things too far, but with a happier society, maybe crime itself would diminish and along with it, the prison industrial system thriving off of actual slave labor. We could have a truly \\*just\\* justice system designed for rehabilitation and eventual full reintegration into society. \n\nWe wouldn’t want for wars or invest billions in gaudy displays of military strength. We wouldn’t care for oil when we’re able to solve the energy crisis. We wouldn’t need to worry about competing with other countries when we’re just focusing on fixing our own issues and when we’re ready, we can make our return to the global community not as a laughing stock or a bully, but as an equal partner on this planet where we can work to establish the same rights we fight for across the human race. \n\nUntil that time, we are stuck with what we have. The starvation wages that are one of so many symptoms stemming from this disease our country has and will continue to spread. The healthcare system will continue to exploit the masses. The politicians will act bemused and concerned when they hear our cries of “more jobs!” or, “No justice! No Peace!”, but they will hear none of it. They knew this was inevitable. Our healthcare workers are donning trash bags with duct tape to prevent the spread of a virus politicians don’t care about while they outfit the police with military grade hardware and of course, military grade air filters for their tear gas. Those filters could have very easily been redirected to hospitals the moment a pandemic was detected, but the people in charge decided that they were more valuable sitting in a warehouse with all the riot gear for when it all hits the fan. \n\nIn case that last sentence didn’t sink in, THEY HAD FILTERS BUT CHOSE NOT TO USE THEM. \n\nThe hundred thousand deaths in America are on the hands of every last person who could have made that decision, but chose not to. \n\nThe blood of every person mauled by police is on their hands too. \n\nThey knew the consequences of their actions and they have been well aware of them for a long time. It’s time we stop playing their games and start taking our lives back. As controversial as this may be, voting has proved itself to be an empty voice time and again to pacify the masses and say, “It’s okay, at least you tried.” when the people choose a candidate the establishment doesn’t want, they’ll play every trick in the damn book to make sure they get their way. They’ll rig the primaries. They’ll “lose” some ballots and invalidate some others on technicalities. They’ll gerrymander the counties and the electoral college will \\*really\\* decide who gets in that damn office. There is no way to win, so we make our own way. We abolish the police. We fight. We rebel. We kick and scream until they are no longer in office or the office no longer exists. I’m sorry to say to all of you, but the evidence is clear and has been for a long time, that the system isn’t just or right. It isn’t fair or compassionate. It isn’t \\*human\\*. Most of all, it fucking \\*hates\\* you. \n\nWe are the shareholders in this country and we have the right to remake this system in whatever way we see fit. Our politicians should not be 60+ years old and asking Mark Zuckerberg what a “Facebook” is when he’s caught violating the privacy of millions. We need an educated government reinvented for this technological age designed for all its people. We should not have a single person in office who thinks that the complete abolishment and reinvention of the police force is an overreaction. We should also not have anyone in power who views people of a different skin color to be less than human and we should not encourage that in our society. I know some of you have seen them too, the closet racists who had been hiding in the shadows for so long until that day in 2016 when they could all come out. They revealed themselves to be our neighbors, our friends, our parents, and our leaders. As a person who is not considered a person by these people, I know what it’s like to have my white friends come to me “joking” about how I should “pick the white side in the race war!” or talk about their discord server for white people only. I know what it’s like to have my black mother threaten me with police execution simply for wanting to move out. I also know what it’s like to have my white father proudly state that I don’t “act black”, whatever that means. As a person who is split right down the middle of this issue of “black and white” (quite literally if you haven’t figured that out yet), I know what it feels like to not truly belong to either “side”. I, as an American citizen with equal rights, demand the creation of a society where everyone can feel like they belong. Is that too much to ask for?\n\nTo all those clutching their proverbial “pearls” out there, I’ve got one last question for you.\n\nWhy should I feel out of place so you can feel safe?",

I work in supply chain logistics for grocery stores, and last year things were obviously pretty rough with the pandemic and all of the panic buying that left stores empty, but this year things are getting crazy again. \n\n It's summer which is usually calm, but now most of our vendors are having serious trouble finding workers.  Sure it makes my job more hectic, but it's also driving prices sky high for the foreseeable future.  Buyers aren't getting product, carriers are way less reliable than in the past, and there's day-weeks long delays to deliver product.  Basically, from where I'm sitting, the food supply chain is starting to break down and it's a bit worrying to say the least.\n\nIf this were only happening for a month or two then I wouldn't be as concerned but it's been about 6 or 7 months now.  Hell, even today the warehouse we work with had 75% of their workforce call in sick.  \n\nAll in all, I'm not expecting this to improve anytime soon and I'm not sure what the future holds, but I can say that, after 18 months, the supply chains I work in are starting to collapse on themselves.  Hold on and brace yourself. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!",

In my mind, humanity is headed in a direction where it simply won't be able to sustain itself. We're killing our planet and each other and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it outside of my own life and two hands. In addition, I suffer from treatment resistant depression, and if things continue to go downhill, I'm not sure I'll even want to be around at that point. Despite attempting to explain this, family simply stares blankly. I don't think they can see things slowly crumbling around us.\n\nThe responsible part of me tells me to put the money in. The other part tells me there's simply no point. A retirement plan isn't going to help in a nuclear water war.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your insights. I feel I've been given some clarity on the situation as a whole, and I feel more confident in the direction I wish to go.",

Kids born today will experience the year 2100, which is already far, far past the times when SHTF.\n\nThink back to what we know about 1940, about WW2 and the lives people lived, the mentality they had. It is not that far back in time. But moreover, think back to the climate of 1940. It was almost exactly the same as 1860, which was 80 years before. But today's climate is \\~1 degree hotter than 1940, and 2100 might be 4+C degrees hotter. We are roasting this place.\n\nWe're always in a mad scramble to salvage what we can in the next 5 years, 10 years, 20 years.

It makes the oft-ignored connection from “simple suburbia” to “apocalypse.” \n\nOne reason it sticks out is the episode shows **how fragile our communities really are.** Take away all the fancy gizmos and abundance, and there are no bonds between neighbors in the suburbs. It takes one night & a murky shadow for a shooting to happen. \n\nAnd in the context of a pandemic, race/class riots, impending ecological collapse and ensuing energy crisis, the fact our communities are so close to burning up (if they aren’t already) does not give me hope for the American system. I don’t want to live through collapse. I don’t want my neighbors & roommates to immediately reach for firearms to secure soon-to-be-scarce resources.

I never subscribed to it because I wanted to compartmentalize it, but every few months for years, I'd tune in to get layman analyses on highly technical data collected by academics in climate and ecology. It introduced me to a few of the data sources I use daily. It introduced me to permaculture and *Limits to Growth*. It helped influence my ideas of community, technology, and how to chart a path as a young person coming of age in the 2010s. It gave me 6-8 weeks of forewarning to prepare for covid hitting.\n\nThere's always been a noticeable streak of nihilism and misanthropy in a lot of the comments here. After all, collapse is a heavy reality to process. But there were always gems of clarity that made wading through here worth it.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's because of new posters or just new dispositions by the same old posters, but over 2020, the quality of the commentary here just took a nosedive into cringe territory as the idea of collapse really gained steam outside this sub. No more sea ice and climate analysis. No more critiques of consumerism. No more collapse-aware analysis of geopolitical moves. No rationality. No Occam's Razor. Now it's just pushing YouTube ranters, talking about how anyone making good-faith efforts is part of some grand conspiracy, and kids ranting about how much smarter they are than everyone who doesn't ascribe to nihilism, and screaming \"boTH SiDDeSsS\" if politics ever gets brought up. It's gotten especially bad since the latest round of subreddit bans.\n\nIt seems /r/collapse was never about being aware of tough and nuanced realities that help you understand what will happen, just being an edgelord. Most people here don't have any real principles. They just like seeing the world burn and base their worldview off how edgy it is. Now that collapse is mainstream, this whole sub has turned into /r/im14andthisisdeep with a dash of /r/conspiracy.\n\nPeace y'all.

        "selftext": "So I turned vegetarian about 5 years ago for environmental reasons - I learned the sheer economy of scale involved in producing meat and the damage industrialised farming does. Okay, great. I'm not one of those meat-is-murder people though - I understand there is a food chain, and I will not hold it against anyone who eats meat. My vegan sister, on the other hand...\n\nI've been following the damage done to the planet for a little longer. Climate change is real and a pressing danger. We are readily outstripping the planet's ability to replace resources we use. It is unsustainable.\n\nWhich is the theme of Seaspiracy. The filmmaker starts off looking at ways fishing could be sustainable. And the one thing that really stuck out at me is how utterly thorough we as a species are when it comes to ruining what nature has given us. I noticed a while back that the bad news covers every sector of environmentalism. Try this - think of your favourite collapse topic, then try to think, 'okay, that's bad, but...' and try to come up with a topic where humans haven't utterly ruined it for current and future generations. We pollute the land, the air, the water, with wild abandon.\n\nIf destroying the planet were a managed project, I would commend the manager for covering every base and accounting for every possibility. 'Don't worry about it, we've dealt with it.' There is a documentary on the ecological disaster for every conceivable topic.\n\nThe best/most striking part of Seaspiracy was watching the spokesman for Earth Island, in one breath, explicitly state that no tuna can be certified Dolphin Safe, despite the fact that they slap this logo on so, so many cans, and in the next breath when asked what the consumer can do, point-blank say 'Buy Dolphin-Safe tuna because it can guarantee dolphin safety.' The doublethink required is right there on the screen. I mean, I never take food labels at face value (my aforementioned sister is an animal activist and has plenty of stories to tell around free-range eggs and their certifications being worthless) but hearing a spokesman for the organisation that allows this logo to be placed on tuna cans, essentially say it was meaningless - really is amazing.\n\nThe filmmaker correctly follows the money trail, and it explains oh so much. These advocates for change are all being paid for by big corporations. Again, I try not to read too much into this - everyone is pushing their own agenda. Heck, I'm pushing my own agenda on you reading this right now by saying this. But knowing that organisations 'dedicated' to saving the oceans are simply on corporate payrolls and spinning it as a consumer problem, it makes so much sense. We've seen this before - a certain massive soft-drink brand are well known for being the biggest source of plastic waste on the planet, and their response was a striking ad campaign that shifted the blame to the consumer for not recycling. For decades, nobody blamed the corporations for creating the waste in the first place or not having some means to take it back. Corporate power is equal parts admirable and terrifying.\n\nSo, same in the oceans. The filmmaker points out that even in photos of dead whales and dolphins washed up on beaches, they are frequently wrapped in discarded fishing nets, or have eaten them. But how is it always described in the news article? 'Plastic waste.' And talks about consumer waste, like straws or cups or masks. When in fact nearly half the mass of the Pacific Garbage Patch is discarded fishing nets, and nobody says a word about it.\n\nComes straight back to corporate power, doesn't it. The global fishing industry is so powerful, the filmmaker implies, that they are able to silence any group advocating to clean up fishing equipment, despite it being the #1 most damaging waste product.\n\nAnd then you think, 'haven't I heard that phrase before?' 'The global \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ industry is so powerful that they are able to spin the narrative to their advantage.' You can insert just about anything into that gap above and it'll be true. Money has too much power. And so long as money is allowed to advocate for corporate rights to destroy the planet, they will. Because there is too much money to be made that way.\n\nAs a result, I continue to believe that nothing will ever be done. The EU Fishing representative was half-hearted in his interview. It was amusing hearing him use a financial analogy to explain 'sustainable' because that is exactly what it comes down to - money, pure and simple. But then learning that major European governments enormously subsidise their fishing industries despite the values returned by fish sales not coming close to the expenditure in subsidy? It makes no sense. Somebody clearly has some very revealing photos of major politicians...\n\nThe whole system is rigged so the little guy, the consumer, the average Joe, has no hope whatsoever of changing anything. And for short-term profit, corporate greed will continue to strip the planet bare and leave nothing for future generations except hardship and doom. And not just one country, but all around the world. Kill the oceans and we kill all life on Earth. But greed...\n\nAnd I'm sure I'm going to see the effects take hold in my lifetime. The global rise of right-wing conservatism means it's pretty pointless trying to get governments to do anything about it, they would rather 'let the market decide.' It sucks to feel so powerless when staring down the barrel of certain destruction, to be screaming into a void where nobody even acknowledges what you say.\n\nI also can't blame anyone for just sitting back and allowing it to happen. Like I said earlier, every base is covered. Even if by some miracle you manage to effect massive change in one niche area, the overarching thoroughness of destroying the planet means it won't be enough. I'd be impressed if this was a managed project, but seeing as the goal is to end life on this planet, I'm not.",

Starting in the 1980s, the Minimum Wage has not been increased regularly to cover the actual cost of living. Now, a person cannot support themselves with a Minimum Wage job.\n\nI believe that this is a very real example of collapse occurring right now. Our Economy is in the process of collapsing right now. \n\nNow, people may try to mitigate the Economy's collapse by having a roommate or reducing their expenses, but this is not growing the Economy. It is actually shrinking the Economy.\n\n----------\n\nFor example, I have calculated the actual cost of living here for someone who lives in my home town (Oklahoma City) and works 40 hours per week at a Minimum Wage job:\n\nRent: $525\n\nUtilities: $100\n\nFood: $100\n\nCell phone: $40\n\nCar insurance: $25\n\nInternet: $40\n\nGas: $100\n\nMiscellaneous: $100\n\n\nTotal Expenses: $1,130\n\nTotal Income: $986\n\n\nTotal: -$144",

        "selftext": "The cyberattack on the Texas-New Jersey pipeline has limited the supply of gasoline in several US states this week. Obviously, the sensible thing to do is in this case is to just act normally, and maybe slightly reduce your fuel usage if you can, since supply levels will be back to normal in a few days.\n\nSo, of course, the entire eastern US has lost their fucking minds, with runs on gas stations spreading to states that aren't even supplied by the pipeline. Along with the amusing reports of idiots putting gas into tupperware and plastic bags to \"stockpile\", there are also some reports of violence between people who are lining up to stockpile something that is only in short supply because people are trying to hoard it and driving demand far above normal levels.\n\n>Fuel demand for motorists has jumped over 30 percent in the East in the past week, over 16 percent in the Midwest, and 13 percent in the Gulf Coast\n\nSeveral states (again, including states that aren't even supplied by the pipeline) have declared states of emergency because of this insanity. Florida (gets their gas by ship) has activated the national guard. Georgia is cancelling gas taxes and lifting restrictions on delivery truck weight, meaning that the state will lose millions while the oil companies rake it in. North Carolina is also waiving a bunch of regulations on delivery trucks, including the maximum hours that truck drivers can work in a 24 hour period. The EPA has waived rules controlling fuel quality for DC, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\n\nI'm watching the response to a relatively minor disruption in the gas supply in the US, and I have to wonder - what happens in the future when there are real shortages of goods or materials, or the next cyberattack on US infrastructure isn't so minor?\n\nIn response to a completely self-inflicted gas shortage that can be corrected in a matter of days, US states have mobilized their national guard, cancelled safety and environmental regulations (albeit temporarily), and decided to enact tax cuts to ensure that megacorps can make as much money off the crisis as possible. And the citizens who are causing the shortage in the first place are getting violent.\n\nAll this from a single ransomware attack by a group that, while claiming to be apolitical, only attacks English speaking countries and leaves former soviet states alone. If DarkSide has no connection to the Russian government, then other groups that are connected to the Russians have to be looking at how effective this attack was. \n\nGood luck to the people in the US who have to deal with the problems when there are real shortages, whether they be a natural result of other systems collapsing or active cyber attacks by hostile foreign powers. Because it's clear that the US public isn't capable of not doing the absolutely worst thing possible in any sort of emergency.",

        "selftext": "This is more of a rant, I'm not one of those people who has all of these sources and scary statistics to back up their claims but I think most Americans can agree with me just based on what they see every day. Our infrastructure is so inefficient and wasteful it's hard to put into perspective. Everything is so far apart and almost nothing is made to have any sort of sustainable transportation be viable, and I live in a relatively old part of the country where things are better than in the South or West. If something were to happen that would cripple the automotive, or trucking industry, it's over. Like I'm pretty sure I would die in a situation where trucks couldn't travel to stock the grocery shelves here. And it's not my fault; we live our entire lives in a country that's not built for people, so if the thing that the country is made for gets incapacitated, the people will die. \n\nNot to mention the fact that our infrastructure is also accelerating the demise of our planet. It's so polluting, wasteful, and inefficient to take cars literally everywhere, yet somehow most people don't see a problem with it, and new suburban developments are still making the problem even worse. On top of that, I believe car culture is damaging to our mental health too, it's making everyone hyper atomized and distanced from their communities. \n\nThe youtuber Adam Something said in a video that car culture is a cancer on American society, but I believe that it's a cancer on the country itself. The way things are right now is so unbelievably bad, and practically nothing is being done about it in our country right now. There are some things that can be done to help bring these cities closer to sustainability and to help reduce some reliance on cars, but in order to make things in this country truly sustainable, we'd basically need to tear everything down and start from scratch. Which I know will never ever happen. Our planet will burn down and humans will become extinct before America dismantles its car oriented infrastructure. There's not very many things that I'm actually doomer about, but this is one of the only ones, because I don't see a way out of car dependency coming soon, if ever.",

If you aren't upvoting collapse related posts, why?\n\n\nI recently joined the construction industry in MN and it's extremely wasteful.  Not a single crew that I see wears masks at work.  Now the supplies are becoming harder and harder to get.  You can ask contractors and most supplies are back ordered with no shipping estimates even given.\n\n\nWe know the jet stream is getting fucked by low ice cover/thickness up north.  The food supply bounced back somehow, but that won't remain long.  My Grandpa got covid-19 and was a life long trucker, he was in decent health early this year and now he is going into assisted living as he stroked out during his stint with covid.  He has no short term memory, but long term remains.   This is just one case but most truckers are older/boomer generation.  As that generation is forced off the road due to covid complications we will see more scarcities.\n\n\nWhen will the USD collapse? Another topic this sub overlooks.  As evictions loom, what's the renters incentive to make up old rent?  People will stop paying rent/unsecured debts and start using cashed checks for supplies.  All those that get evicted will have a nearly impossible time finding another landlord due to last eviction. \n\n\nSoooo much more to say but I'll keep it short.  The next few months will be extremely close to bring about collapse, but it depends on how the elite manipulate the system.  It's going to take at least 10% of us to change the system.  Help make 10% aware that self induced collapse will be favorable for future generations and the animals of Earth.\n\n\nEdit: to everyone asking there is no solution in which all humans live.  This is part of collapse.  I understand that collapse will likely kill me.  I would rather see collapse than the torture of farmed animals, and the killing of wild animals until they go extinct.  If nature has shown us anything it's that it can bounce back if we give it a chance.  \n\n\nYes every possible solution is a pipe dream, I understand that.  But honestly you can either be part of a mini localized solution or you can continue with bau. \n\nGrowing a small garden without pesticides/herbicides may seem like a small act to you, but it takes money away from monocrops, it gives food for your local pollinators, and it ensures you food security a little bit more.",

        "selftext": " I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.\n\nToday has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.\n\nToday was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.\n\nSydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.\n\nWe are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.\n\nThe sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.\n\nIt's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. \"I wish you all the luck in the world\" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is \"We will stand and defend our home.\"\n\nThese aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.\n\nYou'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.\n\nThese thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.\n\nBecause these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.\n\nI've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.\n\nAnd then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be \"funny\" or \"cool\".\n\nOutside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.\n\nI look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.\n\nNever before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: \"*it's on fire\"*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.\n\n\"Climate change?\" they say. \"What climate change?\"\n\nI looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, \"Thank the fates we have it okay here!\"\n\nNow I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.",

        "selftext": "**PREFACE:** I want to be clear that this is some degree of speculation, based on shared anecdotes, and should not be taken as sounding the alarm as much as advising caution. But I fear we are in a repeat of the phase of December 2019 - February 2020, when fears of a global pandemic breaching America were largely derided as fearmongering, and proper precautions were not taken.\n\nWhat I am coming to believe is that July 4th, 2021 was the Democrats' [Mission Accomplished! moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech) of the decade. Much like Bush declared victory over Iraq only to have thousands more Americans killed in a quagmire that ultimately accomplished nothing but empowering a fascist group called ISIS, Biden's 1000-person July 4th party titled *\"AMERICA'S BACK - Together\"* declared COVID-19 [\"no longer controls our lives or paralyzes our nation.\"](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1412160131991752713) What I am going to break down, in my opinion, is that this may not be the case.\n\n400,000 Americans died under Trump. 200,000 have died under Biden's tenure. Estimates say the actual total may be closer to 900,000. So a million American lives have been pissed away via failed half-measures and outright denial of the lethality of an airborne virus. And we just don't care. Hell, one might say we aren't allowed to care. We couldn't pay people to stay home via a temporary UBI, now millions of Americans are going to wind up on the street as the eviction holds begin to lift (and further spread the virus.)\n\n**1)** **The Delta Variant of COVID, which is more lethal, transmissible, and vaccine resilient has appeared in all 50 states.** The further you let this virus run wild, the more time it has to build up resistance and mutate into new variants. Delta is one of these variants; there are more and there will be new ones before the year is out. This did not matter to the people in charge. [In the words of Leila C. Leigh, co-host of the Punch Up Podcast:](https://twitter.com/leilacleigh/status/1413205297435275264)\n\n>Once Biden became President, **the Covid trackers in the media stopped focusing on Covid deaths and shifted to vaccinations. They wanted to sell the narrative that America is back!** Reminder: 400k people died under Trump; over 200k have died under Biden.  But **the only story we're being sold is Covid is almost over and if you get Covid, it's your fault** for being too ignorant to get the vaccination. There are many reasons people aren't getting vaccinated;  it's not just Red State Trump voters who aren't getting vaccinated.\n\nJust like masking up became a culture war wedge, so has getting vaccinated. What many might not know is that the vaccines are not a sterilizing vaccine, as we typically assume vaccines are, such as the Polio or Measles vaccines, etc. You can still be infected by and transmit COVID, even when vaccinated.\n\n**2)** [**Israel's largest newspaper has reported that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness has dropped by 30% in the face of the Delta variant.**](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/?fbclid=IwAR1ShypSuak3FJxHu4RcH1nEe9RTZqX6_fyN1uP-mtd8SGz3LhxW2BwpAwc) Now, let's be clear what that really means, to avoid alarmism:\n\n>Vaccine effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease fell to 64% since June 6, the Health Ministry said. **At the same time the vaccine was 93% effective in preventing hospitalizations and serious illness from the coronavirus.**  \n>  \n>The ministry in its statement did not say what the previous level was or provide any further details. However ministry officials published a report in May that two doses of Pfizer's vaccine provided more than 95% protection against infection, hospitalization and severe illness.\n\nSo people can still get COVID, and transmit it, even when receiving both doses of the vaccine. There is no vaccine for children under 12, and there are still some people who may not be able to get the vaccine for one reason or another. We have thrown caution to the wind with them as of late, as schools proceed to reopen without mask mandates or proper ventilation. Kids are a magnet for disease, which means we risk major superspreader events across all 50 states that could possibly brew or spread newer or more lethal variants.\n\n**3)** [**The epsilon variant of #SARSCoV2, first detected California, carries three spike protein mutations that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by mRNA vaccines or by #SARSCoV2 infection, according to new research in Science.**](https://twitter.com/ScienceMagazine/status/1412290256901128195) So instead of \"trusting the science\" when it comes to airborne pandemics, the Democrats in a rush to declare victory over the Republicans, have found a way to *dramatically and enthusiastically* increase transmission of COVID's new & vaccine resistant variants. Again, a billionaire backed culture war of Team Red vs. Team Blue has  triumphed again over effective leadership to bring an end to this pandemic.\n\n**4)** [**COVID infections are surging across Europe.**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/12/eu-nations-reimpose-covid-measures-as-cases-surge) **Many of these cases, especially in young people,** [**are turning out to be the dreaded \"Long Covid.\"**](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-covid-increase-sajid-javid-cases-summer-105402864.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2NpZW50aXN0LmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSzShsxSK2OqzQKlXe4g9_hDUGBbs15g1uvRRLozupTPL3AyIOu0L8Rw4Qvz2g_x12uqAbZhNxqC3zpOODWL4vvy-5Y7rHC7Ed3bm1it0dILAwr5NdkGmX1qUE-TqjZU_MIuj9fN5ffRhssCQvOfSu3FbZotQXUWYSWrr9dzEmN)\n\n>More than [2 million people in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-research-shows-2-million-people-may-have-had-long-covid) are estimated to be [living with long covid](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033403-600-long-covid-do-i-have-it-how-long-will-it-last-and-can-we-treat-it/) and scientists have warned that plans to ease the majority of the coronavirus restrictions in England on 19 July [could contribute to a rise in long covid cases](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-covid-increase-sajid-javid-cases-summer-105402864.html). “It’s hard to escape a prediction that 100,000 new infections a day equates to 10,000 to 20,000 long covid cases a day, especially in young people. That’s a lot of damage to a lot of lives,” said Altmann.\n\n[Here is a long compilation of headlines from the media,](https://twitter.com/LauraMiers/status/1412440715511087106) shifting over time, from \"vaccinated people should still wear their masks,\" to \"people still wearing masks are progressive looneys,\" to \"we're back to normal!\" to ***\"Hundreds of Epidemiologists \\[aka the science\\] Expected Mask-Wearing in Public For At Least A Year.\"*** What did our leaders in America just tell us? *Drop the masks, you got the shot. Get grillin already, damnit! The average price of a cookout is down sixteen cents! Our corporate handouts are working!*\n\nAnd yet, across the pond: [**Cancer surgeries cancelled at one of England’s largest hospitals as NHS summer crisis deepens**](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/leeds-cancer-surgery-coronavirus-nhs-b1879646.html)\n\n**5)** [**\"Telling fully vaccinated people not to worry about breakthrough infections is reminiscent of harmful early-pandemic attempts to downplay the threat of the virus\"**](https://theweek.com/coronavirus/1002363/breakthrough-covid-infections?utm_source=links&tum_medium=website&utm_campaign=twitter)\n\n>\"Friend messages to tell me has COVID after 2nd vaccine,\" someone tweeted. \"Several people I know have been (badly) infected with Delta after being fully vaccinated,\" [wrote](https://twitter.com/kathryn42/status/1412703198553554944) British journalist Kathryn Bromwich. Many of the anecdotes are coming from the United Kingdom, where I live. Here, the Delta variant of the virus is dominant and case rates are soaring despite half the adult population being fully vaccinated. But they're also trickling out of the U.S. American author John Pavlovitz [shared](https://twitter.com/johnpavlovitz/status/1412607709334097927) how his family contracted the virus despite most of them having received two doses. \"I was fully vaccinated and right now (as my father used to say) I feel like a sh\\*t sandwich without the bread,\" he [said](https://twitter.com/johnpavlovitz/status/1412607709334097927).   \n\nOf course, anecdotes are not scientific data. I started this post saying they weren't, which brings me to the conclusion. I started this post with a historical flashback, and now we're going to bring in another.\n\n**6) FLASHBACK:** [**\"Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country, and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!\"**](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/504026-trump-with-smaller-testing-we-would-show-fewer-cases) **-** said former President Trump, infamously. Now, the argument used to scold many progressives into abandoning any sort of left-wing policy demands was that Biden would \"listen to the science,\" and bring an end to this pandemic. Considering Biden's hard-line defense of health insurance executives and Big Pharma making billions by bankrupting working-class Americans, I knew this was obviously false, not to toot my own horn.\n\nAnd now I have evidence to support that claim, as Biden has adopted Trump's philosophy: [**Abbott begins laying off hundreds of workers as COVID test demand evaporates**](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/abbott-begins-laying-off-hundreds-workers-as-covid-test-demand-evaporates-report) \\- This is happening nationwide. The Biden Administration has effectively declared that every vaccine is 100% effective against every variant of COVID, if the people who receive the vaccine are never tested. And the people who didn't get the vaccine for whatever reason get it? A Just-World Fallacy \"screw 'em, it's their own fault\" as we shrug our collective shoulders.\n\n**7) COVID is still spreading like wildfire through the homeless.** From an Emergency physician researcher: [**\"COVID-19 outbreak at homeless shelter in Santa Rosa, CA. 47 of 153 shelter residents (31%) tested positive even though vaccination rates actually 85% in that shelter!\"**](https://twitter.com/KellyMDoran/status/1413468812163227651) \\- there seems to be no plan to prevent further spread through the ever-growing number of homeless in America. Let them get sick, spread these variants around, and possibly die in the streets. [**\"Keep masking, vaccinating, etc. but airborne spread in shelters seems to have been barely addressed to date and the regulations, at least in NY, on this are minuscule. And please stop celebrating the mythical end of COVID until all our neighbors are safe.\"**](https://twitter.com/KellyMDoran/status/1413471810100895746) **This is not the information we are being given by the Biden Administration or the CDC.**\n\n**8)** From a PhD-MD: [**\"Not surprising. Confined conditions. Just one person can produce enough aerosolized virus to break overcome immunity. 90% protection is the avg protection rate over mostly fleeting exposures in the population. A given situation can be much more infectious than the average event.\"**](https://twitter.com/michaelzlin/status/1413739270993453056) And just who is entering confined conditions in August and September? A very large group of Americans that cannot get vaccinated due to their being under the age of 12. Children!\n\n**9)** From Epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding:  [**the Singapore Delta outbreak proves that vaccinated still transmitted. In this #DeltaVariant cluster alone, among 29 vaccinated who got infected, 21 transmissions events were between vaccinated-to-vaccinated or vaccinated-to-unvaccinated. That’s a lot!**](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1410830290080108544) I think you can slowly start to see what I'm getting at here. Now, let's all remember the effectiveness of decades of Defund The Teachers, and what a shitshow that has been over the past 40 years.\n\n**10)** [**Shocker—school mask mandates were rescinded for early teens in UK on May 17th— cases rise. More shocker—schools close for holidays—cases fall. Even more shocking—cases rise again when schools reopen (with no masks).**](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1410038115239092224) You should really click through for the attached graphic. It's quite shocking.\n\n**11)** Oh, and before we forget, one of the risks of COVID-19 is permanent brain damage. From Nature: [**New evidence suggests that coronavirus’s assault on the brain could be multipronged: it might attack certain brain cells directly, reduce blood flow to brain tissue or trigger production of immune molecules that can harm brain cells**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01693-6) \\- But hey, no worries! You got the shots! Get back to work! *America is Back Together!* Yet \"Long Covid,\" which 1-in-3 infections are at risk for, brings about significant cognitive issues, and [**Delta surge ‘could leave hundreds of thousands with long Covid’**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/13/delta-surge-could-leave-hundreds-of-thousands-with-long-covid)**, with \"Unvaccinated younger sufferers more at risk of debilitating long-term symptoms\"**\n\n**12)** Okay, so let's come home from the UK and take a look at the conditions in American schools that our unvaccinated children will be entering this fall: [**Vaccinated teachers and students don’t need masks, CDC says**](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-science-health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-a65c9c0375ce441fcd10866eb8ea990b) \\- even though *the science* says that in confined conditions, like say, hundreds of people in a single building, the rate of infection will be rather high, even for the vaccinated. Many insisted \"kids can't get COVID,\" even though that makes no logical sense. Kids are magnets for disease. They will bring it home and transmit it through their families, who will pass it along to their communities. So now, under a Democrat President who we were told would \"listen to the science,\" is now... *not listening to the science.*\n\n13) [**“We see further evidence suggesting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission within families, especially in small under-ventilated spaces such as NYCHA bathrooms used by multiple family members.\"**](https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/7/11/22570701/nycha-warned-during-pandemic-of-ventilation-danger?utm_content=buffer4236b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=buffer) So disadvantaged children, who can't get vaccinated, will go to public school, not wearing masks, in decrepit old buildings with poor ventilation, get infected with COVID, Delta or otherwise, bring it home, infect their families, the adults of which will likely be \"essential workers,\" who will be forced to spread it around their communities. All while being told, *\"America is Back Together!\"*\n\nNot even \"progressives\" are speaking up about this reckless shift to abandon mitigation and prevention of this lethal, airborne disease that is continually mutating, that continues to kill and maim vulnerable people at historical scale, and is not going away any time soon. The \"Left\" as we know it, who are supposed to care about human rights and lives, have taken the Biden Administration's line of forced re-opening and disregard for the virus, just as Trump tried to force through in 2020. *We haven't even mandated employers giving workers time off to A) get the vaccine and B) recover from the side-effects,* which has led many \"essential workers\" to avoid getting the vaccine out of fear of losing their job & home, and may of them may become infected, or re-infected.\n\n**14)** [**People who were the first to be vaccinated, such as hospital workers, are now getting infected (or re-infected) with COVID.**](https://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/covid-case-cluster-hits-vaccinated-las-vegas-hospital-workers-2398382/amp/) Eight of the 11 employees of Sunrise Hospital tested positive after attending a party on June 7 - \"eight of employees had been fully vaccinated in December and January.\" We have not been given clear guidance on availability or effectiveness on booster shots for the vaccine. Now remember, the manufacturers never even claimed the vaccines prevented infection or transmission - and this fact has largely been left out of the media, as *\"America is Back Together!\"*\n\n**TL;DR** \\- We are seeing the same \"Trumpian\" policy of rushing to declare victory over a lethal, airborne pandemic that is mutating into new and more lethal forms, from the \"Left-wing\" party that insisted it's Great White Saint would \"listen to the science.\" The non-sterilizing vaccines are not as effective as we have been led to believe. We have largely shut down testing and contact tracing across the country, in a mockery of Trump's controversial comments about \"less testing = less cases.\" The virus is still rapidly spreading in confined conditions such as homeless schools and shelters. The risks of brain damage or \"long-haul COVID\" is on the rise. Children are being railroaded into high-infection scenarios which will further spread this new and more lethal variants. And many who have received the vaccine are becoming infected or even re-infected. All the while, the guidance from our political leaders who we were told would \"trust the science,\" are failing to act.\n\nI do not wish to be alarmist, but to advise caution. Get the vaccine, keep wearing a mask, mitigate risk as much as you can. We are already seeing a spike in infections nationwide after July 4th was host to numerous superspreader events. And as children re-enter poorly ventilated confined spaces in Fall, we will likely be seeing this situation grow much worse in the next four to six months.",

        "selftext": "This might come off as me just ranting but I just wanted to put it out there. \n\nI don’t know what collapse looks like other than from movies, fantasy and whatnot. Grew up in a world that always seems to be ending in one way of another. Carried on like an extra gracing by the main characters. \n\nWorking in the ICU does not make me special - but it’s made me see firsthand that I am not an extra, but a character playing out my role in this tired trilogy of collapse. \n\nThe first wave — circa 20-whatever, came sudden and people died quickly as nothing was known of what was going on. This was a blessing, which I’ll get to. While supplies were limited and the world was in a weird place, treatments were found, used, and conquered only a fraction of the time. \n\nThe rise and fall of each wave was just another, ‘of boy, here we go again.’ I’m guilty, we’re all guilty - we went out, did things, tried to be normal because we’re human. \n\nFast-forward from circa 20-whatever to January 2022 and here we are. Ants battling to save the hill as heavy rains have began to fall. We have more treatments than ever, vaccines, and knowledge — but it’s not enough. \n\nI can only speak for myself, the region I am in, and my personal perception of the situation. In the passed ~2-3 weeks the inevitable has been occurring. Hospitalizations rising with each holiday. People looking to celebrate with those they love, to infect those they love, and lose those they love. \n\nThe ICU is full. Pandemic or not - ICU’s are always full, it’s how the system works. And it normally ‘works.’ Now it’s just full, other units converted (once again) to COVID units to support those on ventilators. And not every nurse can care for those on vasopressin drips, ventilators and critical care needs. The ED is full,  flocks of COVID line the halls with an alcoholic, MVA, and broken bone mixed in the bunch. Waiting. Hours to be seen, days for a bed. \n\nHospitals going on bypass because they cannot physically accept anyone else through the door. Not a COVID patient, not a heart attack. Keep going because the door is locked. \n\nThe cycle of a critical COVID patient goes like this: \n- COVID positive, waits to get care until the shortness of breath is severe \n- Arrived to the ED, triage performed, patient placed on a nasal cannula \n- Oxygen requirements increase, patient placed on high-flow non-rebreather mask\n- Increase some more to a BiPaP mask \n- Increased demand, get consent signed for intubation \n- Patient intubated, transferred to ICU, central lines placed, a-line placed, pressors started\n- At this point the patient either gets worse, or stays the same (usually not better) \n\nDays go by, patient continue to desaturate despite increasing the ventilator setting to max settings, settings not used prior to COVID. Settings you’d read about in fairy tales. \n\nStill not getting better. Okay, let’s flip this 400 pound human on their stomach for 16 hours to help expand the lungs, flip and flop for days. Face becomes swollen, bruised, and supported by bags of water. But hey, being alive is better than a bruised face. \n\nThings don’t get better. Families don’t let go. \n\n^ this is where we are today, and what has led to this. In the off chance a patient does begin tp show signs of ‘improvement’ they end up trach/peg (breathing hole in their throat; feeding tube in the belly) \n\nOthers, sit on the ventilator for weeks, months at a time. Taking up a bed (because they need it) and forcing a patient, maxed on BiPaP, to wait to be intubated to wait for a bed. \n\nThere is NO movement. People keep coming in, but no one leaves. The only way someone leaves, or a bed becomes available is when someone dies. Or a family finally decides to let the death process win the never ending battle. \n\nHow is this collapse though — \n- national guard and agency working in the hospital, great. But also not because they do not know the facility, some do not care for anything more than the checks, others care \n- Ventilators rented from the state, quality compared to a VHS from my mothers flooded basement \n- Medications randomly unavailable; alternatives used until they are depleted. The cycle continues. Constantly calling pharmacy for more paralytics so my patient doesn’t wake up on their belly smooshed between tubes and water bags \n- Supplies equate to the great TP fight of circa 20-whatever — one day it’s vials to test for blood clots, the next it’s pillow cases. But everyday something needed it gone and make shifting supplies feels so ridiculous in the richest country of the world \n- Working 12 hours a day, 5 days a week - sleeping all day and repeat. Running from room to room, alarms blaring, coding, while trying to find the time to sit for just a second before the next alarm starts going, or the next IV drip is empty. I’m fine, I can do this. Others cannot, it’s not sustainable. \n\nAnd my fellow collapse friends - this is where we are. Patching the holes in a sinking ship that cannot stay afloat. Do I have hope that we, humans, get through this, sure. But will we? Do we deserve to? The collapse I imagined was more exciting than this. Stay safe, be informed, and continue on. \n\nTL;DR COVID ain’t nearly finished.",

        "selftext": "I keep seeing posts where people say the most absurd shit about sick, chronically ill, or disabled people regarding collapse. \n\nFor example, people will say that when collapse happens the disabled will all be left to die, and it will be every man for himself, and in these scenarios every human being is reduced to a feral animal who would never show compassion for anyone. \n\nThe problem with this attitude is it's not historically accurate at all. Disrespect and disregard for a lives of disabled people is actually a modern cultural invention, and isn't even universal across modern cultures. \n\nFor example, neanderthals took care of disabled and critically injured or sick people who wouldn't be able to feed themselves or care for themselves. \n\n [here's an old npr article talking about finding fossilized Neanderthals with disabilities and ancient fossils of babies with Down syndrome. ](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/17/878896381/ancient-bones-offer-clues-to-how-long-ago-humans-cared-for-the-vulnerable)\n\n> \"From the very earliest times, we can see evidence that people who were unable to function were helped, looked after and given what care was available.\"\n\n [here's the story of a 500,000-year-old skull- a child that couldn't have grown up as much as they did without help from caregivers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/deformed-skull-of-prehistoric-child-suggests-that-early-humans-cared-for-disabled-children)\n\n\nHere's a quote from a popular post that I saw today. \n\n>Many that should be dead are kept alive by the medical system and ride around the grocery stores on electric scooters after parking in their special needs spot.\n\nOh yes those disabled people riding around on their electric scooters obviously are the real rot of society 🙄\n\nThis quote comes from a poster who I am pretty sure is American and they disparage Americans all the time on this particular subreddit. I'm American and I hate America too but I think that they are projecting their disdain for disabled people or perceived weakness onto the rest of the world when actually that's an American phenomena, not a human one\n\nIt seems that there's an obvious disdain for weakness among some of the people who follow this subreddit and among some of those people they view disability as a form of weakness that shouldn't be tolerated in a post collapse Society. \n\nIn reality human beings are highly pro-social animals that value cooperation and even neanderthals cared for disabled children and adults. We are the species that looked at wolves and said wow these guys look like they would be good friends. We are if anything adaptable, driven, and prosocial. \n\nIn hard times, it is entirely possible that some sick or disabled people may not be able to get their medication, and it's also highly possible that certain Nations cough cough the United States will fail their disabled population, but it's naive to pretend this will be universal across all nations. \n\nIn Nations like Vietnam and Cuba, a sense of strong community Support is valued and they have a much more communal approach to surviving disasters than people in the West. \n\nLook no further than Vietnam succeeding in protecting its most vulnerable from covid-19. They have done one of the best jobs fighting the virus since the very beginning of the pandemic. Compare that to more ableist cultures like the United States which left sick people to die and told people that maybe they should sacrifice their Grandma for the economy. \n\nThe problem is many posters are American in this form and we forget that our way of life is not universal and that our cultural problems are not universal. \n\nIndividual people, including Americans, will not become rabid, ableist genocidal bigots who want to harm wheelchair users just because shit hit the fan. \n\nMore over, Americans unique lack of compassion is only to cost us in the end. You fuck everyone over, eventually people will be mad enough to do something about it and overthrow you. \n\nAmericans can't keep fucking over the entire world and pretending that everyone else lacks compassion when actually it's us that lacks compassion 🤷\n\nWe need to stop pretending that hating those we see as weak, including the sick, elderly, and disabled, isn't as American as apple pie. \n\nAfter All America is the only civilized Nation that doesn't provide health Care to its citizens and victim blames people who can't afford cancer treatment or insulin. We literally price gouge the sick and the vulnerable and then victim blame them for not being able to afford it after they die. \n\nI am a disabled American and I want people to stop acting like ableism is something that doesn't already exist.\n\nDisabled people in the United States cannot legally get married without losing their health care benefits, and we are limited if we get help from the government to $2,000 in total assets which is all possessions so that means we can't have a house or a car if we want help for a disability. The rights of any disabled person can also be taken away under a conservatorship in the United States, if it can happen to Britney Spears for being diagnosed with bipolar disorder it can happen to you.\n\nIt's also legal to pay disabled people sub minimum wage in sheltered workshops, and Governor Cuomo tried to cover up the fact that he left countless elderly people and highly vulnerable people in nursing homes to die during covid-19.\n\nAbleism is a western value. It's not a post collapse value. If anything ableism is part of the problem not part of the solution. Westerners' total lack of compassion towards the weak and the vulnerable(and our endless greed) is the root of everything that's wrong with our society. \n\nIn a post collapse Vietnam/Cuba/Japan/etc, they will be more compassionate than Americans would be in the same situation. \n\nIt's cultural, not inevitable.",

Now, while I cant be sure (no one can) I dont believe thats what collapse is going to look like, but thats besides the point.

        "selftext": "The insane amount of stories to create a narrative that the United States pullout from Afghanistan is some bad decision by the US is amazing.  First they started with the what about the women and children narrative (like even under US rule Afghanistan was some progressive paradise), but that didn't take hold so now they're using the pathetic collapse of the national government as some sort of US failure.\n\nAnyone who has paid attention knew this was the inevitable outcome.  Afghanis by and large have no concept of Afghanistan as a country as it was some random lines on a map drawn by Brits 80 years ago.  Taliban taking over was inevitable because they actually have a cause and are more popular than the US occupying force and an insanely corrupt central government.\n\nHowever, the media at the behest of the MIC has painted this as some epic farce by Biden.  I am far from a Biden fan (in the camp that Obama fucked Bernie to get Biden the nom), but this was probably one of his better decisions.  Yet, on the front of all major news outlets they're painting this as some major fuck up and a growing backlash.  Latest Quinnipac poll has pull out support at 70%, and the fact the country fell in 2 weeks shows it was inevitable.  The fucking BBC's headline articles for a week have been what an epic, unpopular screw up this is.\n\nIf the MIC has the ability to drive this narrative despite its clearly not what people thought to the point that everything supporting it has like 75k upvotes all over Reddit, is it hard to imagine what other insane bullshit they'll keep feeding people till they literally can't hide it anymore.  It's like how they normalized \"heat domes\" this summer like thats a totally normal thing and not proof we are all fucked.  The world is literally ending and they put out glowing pieces about how we should thank a politician for promising to start taking it serious 10 years from now.",

Now, that's all well and good, because action (especially actions which directly aide people in your community who need the help right now) rather than posting is a fine thing indeed. \n\nTo get to the point though, which is a reminder: The United States security apparatus is likely already here and keeping notes. If you get a message from someone who says they were really inspired by your post and that they want to collaborate on a project in real life, a big red siren ought to be going off which says 'this person is a fed'. \n\nI suspect there are a lot of younger persons here with a ton of energy who may not be aware of the fact that the United States government regularly induces mostly young men into radical action and then busts them on terrorism charges. Go ahead and google \"Terrorism Entrapment\" and you will find a number of scholarly articles on the subject, you will also very quickly discover that no defense attorney in the United States has ever successfully argued that the federal government coerced and persuaded their defendant into committing a terrorist act in principle. \n\nConsider the case of [Khalil Abu Rayyan](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2016/04/18/no-bond-dearborn-hts-man-accused-plotting-isis-attack/83197392/), a 21-year old pizza delivery driver from Detroit. Dude was depressed, considering suicide, and one day he gets a message from a cute girl who like him seems equally depressed. They talk for a few months, and before you know it they're making plans not just to meet up but to get married and spend the rest of their lives together. Happy story? Not quite, turns out the girl ain't a girl at all but is a federal agent, and suddenly the only way they can be together is if they run away to join ISIS or commit an act of domestic terrorism. To his credit, Mr.Rayyan really tried to talk her out of it and tried to convince her to seek professional help. For weeks, while dealing with his own profound depression and anger, he tried his best to persuade her that violence was not the way forward. As you might suspect though, he eventually breaks down agrees to do some nasty shit in principle at which point the federal government descended upon him with a 30 year sentence.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't be a fucking moron, trust no one. You want to do some real good in the world? Drop some canned goods or gently used clothes off at your local ~~Salvation Army~~ food bank or homeless shelter. Violence is not any answer at all and certainly isn't going to do a lick of good in reversing climate based annihilation.\n\n—Your Friendly Neighborhood CIA Informant (Parody, or is it???)",

        "selftext": "tldr: There's nothing worse than an older person telling you it's up to us to fix the climate collapse.\n\nYesterday I had a family party, first party in at least 3 or 4 years, where I got to talk with my older relatives and their friends. Unfortunately, they started talking about Covid, how everything \"seems\" more expensive, the rising costs of installing AC, and the wildfires. \n\nBecause I don't have any energy left to talk about climate collapse with people, I hold my tongue for at least an hour. And then my uncle turned his head to me and (paraphrasing)\n\n> Logiman, this is your time to shine and help fix the wildfires. You are the generation that will need to save all of us. I bet someone will invent some great technology that will prevent the rise of CO2\n\nThis was the drop...\n\nWe are in the middle of a mother of all housing bubbles, the wealth gap is bigger than during the french revolution, the student debt loans are astronomical and the rise of nationalism / fascism is seen everywhere. \n\nThey had dozens of years to fix it or at least not to make it worse but the boomer and older GenX wanted to have it all. To have 3 cars, cheap houses, the whole American dream, cheap oil, cheap meat, cheap plastic, cheap food, cheap everything. But who cares right? Who cares for what will happen in 10+ years if they can't even think a year ahead. \n\nI exploded and told them that thanks to their actions of wanting more and more and not living simply they destroyed my, and their children's, future. That I tried to warn people and change their stance but I remember when they told me 12+ years ago \"You're young, you'll see it will not be as bad, climate change is natural\". And now, even if we wanted to, we will never be able to have a 4 bedrooms house, 3 cars, and 5 kids in 2040. Because in 2040 we will be lucky if we have drinking water. \n\nAnd o top it all off, I then started listing all the possible future migration issues, possible water wars and peak oil. It was a fun ride. \n\nAfter my burst, all I could see is empty stares. (like in this Toy story meme) Idiots, idiots everywhere. It seems like they turned off their brains the moment I told them how catastrophic the future looks like. Some of them tried to tell me that during the cold war they also feared for the future. Why is it so hard for them to understand that climate collapse doesn't wait for a general to press a button? Sure some of them were afraid of a possible apocalypse. But we are living already in a future where [Oceans are warming at the same rate as if five Hiroshima bombs were dropped in every second](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/world/climate-change-oceans-heat-intl/index.html) and THEY PRESSED THE F* BUTTON. \n\nThe time for change is way over, now we must prepare and scale down our consumption. \n\nAnd at this point, my aunt arrived at the party with a big ass cake with a smile \"who wants some\". Seriously it looked like a scene from \"Years and years\"\n\nOh, and of course, at the end, my parents told me that I shouldn't be so aggressive and do I want them to have a heart attack. \n\nP.S: At least I should be happy I don't have any Q in my family...\n\np.s.2: And I'm more on the older side than the younger side. so I can't imagine what GenZ has to go through.",

What do you think collapse looks like to the Chinese? It is, of course, the Chinese who are best placed to take over as global superpower as US power fades. China has experienced serious famine - serious collapse of their civilisation - in living memory. But right now the Chinese people are seeing their living standards rise. They are reaping the benefits of the one child policy, and of their lack of hindrance of democracy. Not saying everything is rosy in China, just that relative to the US, their society and economy isn't collapsing.\n\nAnd yet there *is* a global collapse occurring. It's happening because of overpopulation (because only the Chinese implemented a one child policy), and because of a global economic system that has to keep growing or it implodes. **But that global economic system is American**. It is the result of the United States unilaterally destroying the Bretton Woods gold-based system that was designed to keep the system honest (because it couldn't pay its international bills, because of internal US peak conventional oil and the loss of the war in Vietnam).\n\nI suppose what I am saying is that the situation is much more complicated than most of the denizens of r/collapse seem to think it is. There is a global collapse coming, which is the result of ecological overshoot (climate change, global peak oil, environmental destruction, global overpopulation etc..). And there is an economic collapse coming, which is part of the collapse of the US hegemonic system created in 1971 by President Nixon. US society is also imploding. If you're American, then maybe it is hard to separate these two things. It's a lot easier to separate them if you are Chinese. I am English, so I'm kind of half way between. The ecological collapse is coming for me too, but I personally couldn't give a shit about the end of US hegemony.",

The moderator team tries hard to vet and curate all academic  and media sources when they cover collapse, and the mod team and  community is in agreement that the Daily Mail is no longer suitable.  Other problematic sources were identified by the community, and the mod  team will ask for community feedback if those sources become posted as  frequently as the Daily Mail. \n\nRedditors are strongly encouraged to verify collapse stories if they  originate from the Daily Mail, and to link to another source on this  subforum. \n\nOur community has also asked that we enforce stronger submission  guidelines for collapse news and topics. We have expanded Rule 11 to say  the following: \n\n>Rule 11: Link posts must include a submission statement (comment on your own post).  \n Link posts must include a submission statement (comment on your own  post). Submission statements must clearly explain why the linked content  is collapse-related. They may also contain a summary or description of  the content, the submitter’s personal perspectives, or all of the above  and must be at least 150 characters in length. They must be original and  not overly composed of quoted text from the source. If a statement is  not added within thirty minutes of posting it will be removed.  \n \n\nThis is for all link posts, self-posts, image posts and anything  else. This rule is in effect save for Casual Friday, where moderators  will remove content at our discretion if they do not fit the forum.  \n\nMahalo nui loa, \n\nsome\\_random\\_kaluna",

The exit polls are predicting a loss for Labour worse than anything since the second world war.\n\nI don't have much faith in party politics, but this Labour movement was radical and something I felt I could finally get behind. They had an ambitious target of aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 with a plan for nature and a green industrial revolution. Obviously, even this was not enough, but it would have been one of the most ambitious aims of anywhere in the world. \n\nWe had an opportunity to become a global leader towards a sustainable and equitable world. Even if that only means damage prevention at this point, it still would have counted for something. When no one else is taking a lead on the global stage, how can we possibly ask the rest of the world now to follow us now? The ramifications will be a continuation of rising far-right-wing politics as opposed to the beginning of the revolution we so desperately needed.\n\nI have held on to my optimism until now but the sheer number of people who voted for such a despicable power has tonight left me defeated, dejected and heartbroken. There is no overcoming this level of ignorance and mass manipulation in the time we have left and I truly fear for what is coming now; it suddenly feels more real than ever.\n\nI apologise if this is depressing, I just needed to get this off my chest and I don't know where else to turn.",

Comments which aren't explicitly racist, as they don't mention nor make allusions to race, but are still disparaging of poor nations in general. One prominent example was that thread about Egypt's population. (Is it just me, or overpopulation discussions are always centered on the global South?) People will often also make light of poor countries' sovereignities, for instance suggesting the US / \"western\" countries would invade Brazil to \"take better care of the Amazon\". Just now, I read a comment suggesting poor countries' agriculture is more damaging to the environment than rich nations' factory farming, because \"they live among the animals and let them shit everywhere\". I've seen people outright say they're stocking up on ammo for when the climate refugees start trickling into the US.\n\nSo, I wanted to know if the rest of the community recognizes this as a problem as much as I do. For the mods, perhaps I'd suggest a specific \"xenophobia\" report option. What do you think?",

I don't see a group organizing (yet) to do whatever it takes to prevent collapse from happening either.\n\nI have pivoted from feeling wildly hopeless to wildly grateful. The first half of my life has been spent enjoying the comforts of Western life, something I've taken for granted until just recently.\n\nAccepting collapse also included realizing how special those modern day comforts really are. Safe running water, reliable electricity, comfortable furniture, western medicine, kitchen appliances, washer/dryer, a car, 24/7 internet access, food still in the grocery store, trash pickup, soft linens, soft pillows, all of it. The majority of human beings that have ever lived on this planet did not have all of those luxuries at their disposal.\n\nAccepting collapse meant accepting that a lot of those comforts will go away in the future. I have zero control over it. I can't force corporations or governments to operate in ways that will not kill humanity. Besides, was us having all that bullshit sustainable anyways? Obviously not, because we're actively watching collapse happen. It has taken the exploitation and suffering of countless human beings, mostly POC and underdeveloped countries, and the earth itself to make it possible.\n\nInstead of feeling hopeless, I work on feeling grateful that I won the \"where I was born\" lottery and have enjoyed the level of comfort that I have. Most human beings that have ever lived throughout all of history couldn't imagine the state of luxury and convenience I have been living in my whole life. So I feel grateful, because I know one day it will drastically change and I won't have the same level of comfort anymore. \n\nAlso, daily meditation practice is crucial.\n\nEdit: I'm so grateful this has brought so many people a little bit of joy. I've really been struggling with a dark depression after becoming collapse-aware. I've realized that I'm useless to myself, my family and friends, and society in that state of mind. Suffering from depression about collapse keeps me from being able to actually do something about it. If this can help even one person create a light at the end of the tunnel for themselves, it was worth the hate I knew I'd get by sharing this in this sub. Oh and I was serious about the daily meditation thing. Thanks everyone!",

Since 2001, we have been at war in Afghanistan, we've only lost 2,420 by what is considered one of our history's bloodiest conflicts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week, over 20,000 Americans died from COVID-19. Another 30,000 will suffer some sort of medical injury that will last their entire lifetime. AND WE DON'T FUCKING CARE. There's no national mourning, no one is wrapping themselves around an American flag for not being \"patriotic enough\". Soon we'll have lost enough people to fit the definition of a minor genocide, and everyone's more worried about when Chipotle's going to open again than even try to stomach the amount of bodies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm scared for the future. If we're willing to stomach 2,000 people dying daily today, then what will we be willing to stomach when the real collapse hits? 10,000? 100,000? Would every human on planet Earth have to starve to death before as a society we say \"that's enough bodies\"? When will it end?",

Ukraine has stopped all exports as ports are closed and Russia is now being sanctioned by nearly every nation on the planet and may not be able to sell their wheat. This means serious wheat shortages. \n\nBut Turkey is most as risk here. They get nearly ALL their wheat from Ukraine  and Russia. With both sources at risk they are now scrambling to find another source of wheat. This is on top of their 48% inflation rate currently! these are the type of crises that cause not just economic hardship but actual collapse. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/3/3/wheat-corn-prices-surge-as-consumer-pain-mounts\n\n>Wheat, corn prices surge deepening consumer pain.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens the already-tight global supply of corn and wheat.\n\n>Wheat prices jumped 37 percent and corn prices soared 21 percent so far in 2022 after rising more than 20 percent in 2021. Persistently rising inflation has already prompted companies like Kellogg’s and General Mills to raise prices and pass the costs off to consumers and that pattern may worsen with the current crisis.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-25/war-in-world-s-breadbasket-leaves-big-buyers-hunting-for-wheat\n\n>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is threatening shockwaves through two of the world’s staple grain markets, prompting countries that rely on imports from the region to seek alternative supplies and heightening concerns about food inflation and hunger. \n\n>Grain exports from Russia will probably be on hold for at least the next couple of weeks, the local association said on Friday, after turmoil erupted in the Black Sea. Ukrainian ports have been closed since Thursday.\n\n>That means the war has temporarily cut off a breadbasket that accounts for more than a quarter of global wheat trade and nearly a fifth of corn. Major importers are already looking at their options to buy from elsewhere, and prices for both grains swung wildly in the past two days. \n\nhttps://www.grainnet.com/article/263809/grain-trader-bunge-says-sanctions-may-have-adverse-effect-on-russian-operations\n\n>The conflict is threatening to further tighten global grain and edible oils supplies, likely exacerbating soaring food inflation.\n\n>Russia and Ukraine supply nearly 30% of the world’s wheat exports, about 19% of corn exports and around 80% of sunflower oil.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/19/world/europe/turkey-inflation-economy-erdogan.html\n\n>Turks have been hit with runaway inflation — now officially more than 48 percent — for several months, and criticism is growing even from Mr. Erdogan’s own allies as he struggles to lift the country out of an economic crisis. The Turkish lira has sunk to record lows. Food and fuel prices have already more than doubled. Now it is electricity.\n\n>Even as Mr. Erdogan raised the minimum wage last month to help low-income workers, his government warned that there would be an increase in the utilities charges it sets. But few expected such a shock.\n\n>“We are devastated,” said Mahmut Goksu, 26, who runs a barbershop in Konya Province in central Turkey. “We are in really bad shape. Not only us, but everyone is complaining.”\n\n>Mr. Goksu’s January electricity bill soared to $104 from $44, and is now higher than the monthly rent he pays on his shop. “My first thought was to quit and get a job with a salary, but this is my business,” he said.",

That is how the Netherlands became an economic powerhouse and it took British pressure for this atrocity to finally come to an end on Dutch soil in the late 19th century.\n\nBut I am here today to bring you good news, because the people have had enough and capitalism is now finally going to die its long overdue death.

This is a company that has funded climate change denials for decades and funded the Nigerian military to deal with peaceful protestors. \n\nJust like the first multinational corporations that came into existence in the Netherlands and traded in human beings, this company is little more than a vehicle that serves to enrich a small number of people at the cost of people who will have to pay with their lives.\n\nThis has to stop and it is going to stop. [Last year was the last Shell shareholder meeting in history.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2S7F6Ln0vg) But now, for the first time in history, the people are going to invade the conference and stop the Shell shareholder meeting from taking place. We will do whatever it takes to wipe this company out of existence. Shell is where the war starts, but it is not where it ends. All the fossil fuel companies will meet their end.\n\n[May 19 2020 in the Hague](https://code-rood.org/nl/event/shell-must-fall/) is where the world will change forever.\n\nBe there.",

        "selftext": "Tonight, I was watching the news while high and started experiencing some big time disassociation. Seeing people in suits. Talking about made-up shit like stocks. Things are losing meaning nowadays. But what I took the most umbrage at of all were the corporate attempts to reassure me. For instance, car ads with quotes such as: \n\n\"Today, the road ahead is unclear, but soon, it will be clear again. When that time comes, we'll help you get right where you want to go.\" \n\nPromises like these are being peddled by the elite and their corporations. Those of whom are directly responsible for the type of selfish, meddlesome behaviors that got us in this mess to begin with. Society needs re-evaluation. Top-to-bottom overhaul. Not that this is feasible...\n\nSo many have bought into this superstitious belief that 2021 will be some divine and miraculous reparation for 2020... As if humanity deserves any more indemnity for what has been done over the decades. We already had way more comfort than we ever earned. At long last, our vile acts of selfishness are catching up to us. If the pandemic ends, I dread to think we will simply return in full force to the habits that got us here, thus expediting the arrival of the next disaster. Quite the vicious cycle. \n\nOffice buildings stand where forests once did. For what? So the suits can go to business meetings for shit that society has inflated with spurious pertinence. Most of the highest paying jobs could be abolished and Earth would be a better place for it. How fucked is that? The elite are only interested in the short term... Their own status and ostentatious gluttony. The inadvertently culpable sheep won't see that though. Their unconscious directive is to be slaughtered and fleeced. The moment Covid is over, everyone intends to go back to consoooming the \"normal\" amount. Filling our sky with the \"normal\" amount of con trails again, the ocean with the \"normal\" amount of trash again, the streets with the \"normal\" amount of exhaust again... None of this was normal to begin with.\n\nNot that I have any answers. We are too far gone. Society wouldn't adjust to a drastic change now anyway. But I feel vindicated. For as long as I could critically think, I have harbored misgivings with our unnatural and destructive way of life. The veneers have been stripped at last. It is clear. Our system was never sustainable but it was fun while it lasted. Those of us that had years of naive comfort growing up in a first-world nation should feel lucky. The universe doesn't owe us a damn thing. The fact we were able to function the way we have for this long is already impressive. \n\nConsidering our bestial roots; from an impartial perspective, our lives are no more valuable than the animals we've continually disregarded. It is even fair to say we are of less value, since we've proven to be the main detriment to our only home. We reap what we sow.\n\nFuck it.",

        "selftext": "I've noticed that either due to r/collapse's growth or a new moderation team, there is a lot of hopium going on about global communism as a solution for our expanded population.\n\n\nI am here today to give newcomers a few words to google.\n\n\nOur population is not sustainable and a large amount of people will die because we have overleveraged our planet's carrying capacity by forcing overproduction of the soil using petroleum-generated nitrogen and phospates to cultivate monocultures. What does this phenomenon mean?\n\n\n1) The soils are depleted of micronutrients that make up good topsoil. We have \"60\" years of it left, which means, realistically, about 30 considering droughts and everything else. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/\n\n\n2) Monocultures are extremely succeptable to plague. For this reason being anti-GMO is a bad idea, because we have gone so far into GMOs our only way out is high speed modification of our environment to respond to the challenges we are facing. If you think we can magically stop using gmos, feed everyone and sing kumbaya, you are delusional and we, frankly, do not have the time to deal with your purposeful misinformation cascading. Because that's what climate collapse denial is at heart: a very, very dangerous misinformation cascade.\n\n\n2.5) Climate change fucks up every single plant we have. That's what I mean by \"droughts and everything else\".\n\n\n3) We are salting our soil. Overwatering causes salt to rise up through the soil into the topsoil, where it cannot be broken down by plants, and nothing can grow. You know those weird circular patches you see on the farmlands from satellite images? Salt, baybee. EDIT: no I'm not talking about crop circles. I said \"patches\" for a reason. Google soil salinization by overirrigation. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-salinization\n\n\n4) In order to maintain the rate of food production required to support all these people - where our natural environmental carrying capacity number is maybe 3 billion and an overleveraged post collapse capacity is 500 million - we are destroying what is left of our ecosystem, namely the remaning large forests on earth (tundra, amazon, canadian west) which function as the lungs of the earth. You know, producing oxygen and cooling the earth by absorbing carbon and so on.\n\n\n\nThat's just the agriculture. \n\n\n1. Let's go on to the oceans, shall we? Good news, the earth has another lung! Bad news, it's the ocean. So why was passing 4.00 ppm of CO2 such a bad thing anyway? Because our oceans regulate our CO2 by acting as an equilibrum generating chemical buffer. It absorbs CO2, the aqueous form of which is an acid, and neutralizes it. At 4.00 ppm CO2, that is too much acid to neutralize. The buffering effect collapses and we enter the world of Ocean Acidification. Oceans can stand a little acid, right? Wrong. Phytoplankton are the grass of the ocean ecosystem, and they dissolve in acid due to being largely calcium based. They are tiny and barely live more than a week, but due to their huge numbers and oxygen production, by volume they are the backbone of oxygen production from the ocean (a huge part of our oxygen) and the backbone of the marine ecosystem. collapsing them will lead to a trophic cascade of death for marine life. (yes, everything. remember the energy transfer pyramid from 10th grade bio? this is the grass.) \nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003446\n\n\n2.  Forced fertilization of our ecosystems does have a benefit for someone: algae, which choke out all other marine life when the nitrogen gets into the oceans. Literally, as they deplete oxygen.\n\n\nThis isn't even covering the meat production or water cycle. Realistically, I know a lot of people here believe we can sustain a population that \"will probably stop at 10 billion\" with current agriculture, if we just stop eating so much meat and redistribute the food better. I'm here to tell you that's hopium to the nth degree: our entire food systems are overleveraged and threatening to collapse, and when they collapse it's not going to be like \"oh we can plant more things there\" it's going to be like \"oops we made a barren wasteland.\"\n\n\nKnocking down possible solution hopium:\n\n\n1) \"Oh, but the permafrost will thaw and we can just migrate the food production to canada!\" No, we can't. The soil under the permafrost is just as barren and acidic. Because it's been under permafrost for millenia.\n\n\n2) \"oh, we can just use solar power to create vertical farms!\" Solar power is dependent on global supply networks of rare earth metals, as well as a shitload of plastic for wiring, and constant replacement and upkeep. It is nowhere near as green as you think it is once you calculate all the turnover and human suffering that goes into a solar panel. Secondly, vertical farms still need fertilizer. Third, it's basic physics: you cannot produce as much energy through processed sunlight as you would by growing plants under normal sunlight. Fourth, it doesn't support any plants that aren't short and leafy. That's not food, that's mineral supplements. \n\n\nWe can't support 10 billion people. It's very likely that in the next 100 years we'll be barely capable of supporting 500 million. Your scales for planetary social change are not realistic and based in hopium. People are going to die, dave.\n\n\nt. zoomer scientist. (biotechnology + molecular biology).\n\n\n\nEDIT: phosphorus (which we use to generate phosphate) is running out as well. thanks u/thehourglasses\n\nTLDR:  it doesn’t matter if we can produce enough food for everyone with the current industrial system. the system to produce that food is massively unsustainable and living on borrowed time.\n\nEDIT 2:\nYou can't just take a genuine problem, \"our system is unsustainable for all these people and we are risking collapse\", assume a conclusion, \"kill people hehe xd\", claim I'm drawing that conclusion, and get mad at me for it. I'm listing the problems with the claim. No ideology will make the problem go away, only concentrated work in the agri sector will do that (hopefully).\n\nI suggest limiting yourself to blaming people for being ecofacists when they're actually promoting ecofacist ideals and not when they're pointing out genuine limitations in the system. Unwillingness of the centre to acknowledge problems is what pushes people to extremes. I opened the conversation because I, shockingly, wanted to hear the conversation, the content of which has plenty of good arguments (as found in this thread.)",

We've now come to think the positives of appearing in r/all outweigh the negatives:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Pros\n* More visibility for r/collapse and r/collapse content\n* Promote collapse awareness\n* Encourage sub growth\n\n##Cons\n* Creates potential for larger, sudden influxes of subscribers\n* Discussions in posts which reach r/all or r/popular would potentially contain more instances of users who are not subbed to r/collapse or less collapse-aware\n* Encourages sub growth\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe're far more comfortable than we were a few years ago weathering sudden influxes of new subscribers. We're more able to granularly control how posts and comments by unsubbed users appear with Reddit's Crowd Control, so we don't consider these influxes a significant area of concern. Reddit is also [extending these features](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/schw0n/crowd_control_now_supports_filtering_posts/) which make it easier to moderate or filter posts from users not subbed here, if we ever wish to discuss implementing them temporarily or going forward.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe growth of r/collapse itself can be seen as positive or negative depending on how it is framed, how fast the growth is, and how our ability to moderate and maintain the forum evolves. We have confidence we can take on the potential for more visibility, but the extent to which this would actually lead to more people in the sub is difficult to measure or predict. The sub count has been growing at an [increasing rate](https://subredditstats.com/r/collapse) for some time and we've navigated a variety of challenges throughout.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe goal with this change would not be to promote growth for growth's sake (the irony there would not be lost on anyone), but to create more opportunities for collapse-awareness across Reddit. Higher levels of collapse-awareness would mean more potentials for mitigation, adaptation, and less denial, however intangible. We're not under the illusion checking a box will accomplish this significantly, but these would be our motivations driving this change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on us changing this setting?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Update**\n\nThe majority sentiment looks to be we should NOT allow r/collapse posts to appear in r/all, even as a temporary experiment. Although, it seemed unclear to some that the moderation team would be comfortable taking on the additional work (we wouldn't be proposing the change otherwise). \n\nI can't say I've been personally persuaded by the arguments against making the change (just to be honest), but we're collectively unwilling to make any changes a majority of the subreddit is not in favor of. Thank you all for your input, especially those who were willing to elaborate. If you actually read this far, let us know by including the word 'ferret' in your comment.",

Both reservoirs are at their lowest points.\n\nWith long-term severe drought continuing to take a toll on the Colorado River, the federal government announced on Monday that it will retain some water in one of the river’s major reservoirs, describing it as an extraordinary action to temporarily stave off increased uncertainty in water and electricity supplies in the West.\n\nThe decision to keep more water in Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border, rather than releasing it downstream to the other major reservoir, Lake Mead near Las Vegas, comes as both are at record-low levels after 20 years of drought made worse by climate change. Powell, behind Glen Canyon Dam, currently holds less than one-fourth of the amount it held when it filled after the dam was built in the 1960s.\n\n“We have never taken this step before in the Colorado River basin,” said Tanya Trujillo, an Interior Department assistant secretary. “But the conditions we see today, and the potential risks we see on the horizon, demand that we take prompt action.”",

All I've ever really wanted is to just chill and take life slow. But now that I'm fully cognizant of collapse and aware how imminent it all is, I actually feel a lot more relieved and relaxed in my day to day life.  \n\n\n I don't feel the need to start a career and grind for 30+ years just to make marginally more money. I don't feel like a waste for not going to college or entering the trades. I don't care about not being able to buy a house or start a family in the future. If anything, it's better that I don't to begin with. As long as I'm able to rent a room with roommates that aren't total dicks, I think I'll be happy right up until society catches up to collapse and I enact the high velocity retirement plan I've had on the back burner for a while. It helps that I don't really have anyone to worry about except myself and my close family, though.   \n\n\nIDK, might just be the nihilism that stems from the realization that everything everywhere is fucked and will only get worse from here. If nothing actually fucking matters I might as well do what makes me happy now while I still can, instead of trying to work myself to the bone for a payoff I know I'll never see.

        "selftext": "This awful, everything is horrible. We got through a hard winter, feed prices are high, hay is high, fuel is high, and summer is coming in like a rocking ball. Grass isn't coming in like it should and fertilizer is just too pricey. To make ends meet we sent a prize winning registered heifer to auction expecting to get $2,200 at minimum. She sold for $900. Worse than that, the other cattlemen were sell8ng off half-starved cows and newborns with the umbilical cord attached because we are all so pinched for funds and resources. This week I started growing banana trees to help supplement the girls and transplanting cattails into the pasture in hopes that it'll be hardy enough to withstand whatever weather events we get this year.\n\nI thought we had more time. Now I wonder if we can support these animals for even 2 or 3 more years.\n\nEDIT: I am a Texas cattle rancher. \n\nI live in what used to be wetlands, but the ecology now is such that there are large dry, clay areas, and some land dips that retain water and those dips are where I've been planting the cattail and banana trees. \n\nI did not choose the the ranch life. My father-in-law passed in 2016, my husband has had this land since the 1840s and dies not want to sell. I'm a psych grad student and do PR for nonprofits, but those animals have kept us afloat through many hard times. I've just been learning as I go for the past 6 years.\n\nWith land like this, you cannot keep your agricultural tax exemption if you don't keep animals on it - specifically commercial cattle. We cannot afford the taxes otherwise. Even with the exemption we struggle to find enough money to pay the taxes.\n\nI don't know anything about growing large crops, nor do I have the hundreds of thousands of dollars to jump into that kind of operation. I have $470 in my bank account.\n\nI do not eat red meat. I grow backyard vegetables and can my own foods to offset grocery costs. I keep a few chickens for a supply of eggs. \n\nWhen I say I thought I had more time, I mean I thought I had more time to transition. My dream since we moved here in 2016 has always been to use our land as a wildlife refuge, restore native fauna, and set aside acres for solar energy. But then, where do I find the money to invest in such an enormous project? I'm not some trust fund baby; I grew up far far in the country, in the woods, a shack without hot water or electricity.\n\nHaving land doesn't make me rich. Being a rancher doesn't mean that I'm conservative. Being stuck in a position that contributes to the climate crisis doesn't mean I don't care. Having cattle doesn't mean I don't love my animals. Being Texan doesn't mean that I want to burn the world to the ground. \n\nI'm just a man, trying to pay most of my bills, and getting by the only way that I'm able to. Those cows are the only ones protecting us from being homeless and they are the only sliver of hope we have of one day putting away a few thousand dollars if some tragedy should strike.\n\nFor the dumbasses: I am growing banana trees to supplement cattle nutrition. I don't need bananas, the cows need the leaves and stems for food. Cattails usually do well in water pit areas, and the cows love them. Grow tf up. Land isn't just arid or just wet. For the other fools, grass growing in non-grazed areas is wildly different that grazed pasture.\n\n In addition, why is it so hard to believe that a gay man, married, with a background in PR, earning a Master's in Psych & runs a ranch exists?\n\nI'm literally just a human being who has more jobs than one, wearing several hats, and I am frightened about the collapse. I'm terrified that my nieces will be prosecuted for having an abortion or miscarriage, I'm scared that TX will pass a bill nullifying my marriage. WTF is wrong with you people?! \n\nIf you genuinely believe that ranchers and farmers are not collapse aware, you are a complete fool. We live the land and we see it and feel it. We are trapped in an imploding system. Just so you are aware, we are also struggling to fill the fridge and pantry. We are not rich. We are not even well off. \n\nThose commenters who chose to be nasty, get a grip. We are all going down. The whole globe is suffering. Don't be such a dick. I'm only someone who shared their experience, I'm not fucking Elon Musk.",

What’s the point of budgeting and investing and trying to save money… if you don’t already have a shit ton of it, you’re playing a game that was designed to keep a select few winners and everyone else losers in perpetuity. I never wanted to play. I just wanted to get by in peace. But now they’re making almost impossible just to scrape by. \n\nI’m kind of “lucky”. Late Gen-X. Decent job. Good pay. Small Homeowner. University graduate. Did everything I was “supposed” to do and am still getting fucked over every single day. And I have it good compared to the generations after mine. I’m lucky if I break even every month with ridiculous gas prices and skyrocketing grocery prices. Really lucky. And I don’t spend money needlessly. Go out maybe once a month, a few bucks on hobbies. The rest is eaten away by “inflation”…\n\nI fear for my kids who are still very young, I feel for millennials and Gen Z who were born into this shitshow without a Goddamn chance. My generation is probably the last who will have it better than their parents, and even then only slightly better.\n\nSick of “experts” talking about inflation and the economy like they’re fucking fundamental laws of the universe like gravity or electromagnetism. They’re man-made rules and systems that can change overnight if we wanted to. \n\nSick of politicians lining their pockets and shrugging their shoulders like “waddaya gonna do?” When people just want to get by and live in peace but they will not let us.\n\nSick of the greed, the corruption, the lies, the misinformation, the willful ignorance and blindness to the economic violence and warfare upon 99.9% of the people by a select few and their lackies.\n\nFuck it and fuck them all. When it all collapses the ones on “top” will not fall the hardest but will be pulled down and torn to shreds by the masses.\n\nEnough is enough. I’m done.\n\nEDIT: for those who are asking/curious:\n\n- I’m Canadian, lived here all my life. It’s better than the US but it has been rapidly declining. We’ve been coasting with a “hey at least we’re not the US” attitude since the mid 90s and it has bit us in the ass big time. Cost of living and housing are through the roof… healthcare and education and infrastructure are crumbling \n\n- I have not given up. I’m just done. I will continue to fight and resist this system in any way I can but I am not going to run in this hamster wheel anymore. Not gonna worry about debt and finances anymore because then I won’t live my life.\n\n- Better than our parents doesn’t mean more stuff or more money. More and better education, healthcare, society, more freedom from violence, poverty, exploitation, more peace, more REAL development of human potential… the true betterment of humankind with every generation\n\n- STOP PLAYING BUT DONT STOP FIGHTING \n\n“One, two, three and four \n\nThe devil's knocking at your door \n\nCaught in the eye of a dead man's lie \n\nStart your life with your head held high\n\nNow you're on your knees with your head hung low \n\nBig man tells you where to go \n\nTell them it's good, tell them okay \n\nDon't do a goddamn thing they say”",

        "selftext": "I’m an engineer and have been doing this for 20 years. While there is a huge upswing in acceptance and demand for climate assessments of key infrastructure (water, wastewater, energy, etc.), the results get watered down because of uncertainty and time horizons of decades. Even for things like sea level rise with a clear trajectory, it is only a question of when for billions (if not trillions) of dollars in coastal assets to be flooded on the regular. Yet there is still substantial investment in coastal development, even with many areas currently experiencing regular flooding. In fact, in the US, there isn’t even a mechanism to deal with what’s on the horizon for coastal flooding. You would need to basically buy out properties, plus we incentivize high risk construction in flood zones with below-market-rate flood insurance backed by the federal government.\n\nThe way we recover from disasters is by moving people away from impacted areas and bringing in resources from unaffected areas. When a community loses its water supply, bottled water is trucked in. How are we going to respond when there are fewer and fewer areas that are not experiencing or actively recovering from some sort of disaster. The arid west in the US is heading in that direction with fires, drought and electrical grid issues. The area is so large that millions of people could be affected. Bear in mind the Paradise, CA fire occurred 3 years ago. A city of 18,000, and people are still in temporary housing.\n\nModern civilization exists because of highly complex and inter-related infrastructure systems. For example, most people don’t consider that our modern water supply system is what allows dense urban and suburban construction. A prolonged power outage will cause a loss of the water supply and loss of fire flow capacity. Any fire will then have the potential to become one of the great fires like what occurred in New York, Chicago and San Francisco more than a century ago.\n\nI fear the steady onslaught of disasters and regional failures will be like a malaise that saps our strength and vitality. The emotional and economic burden on society will be what drives us towards a full collapse. I can’t say when it will occur, maybe 5 years, maybe 15 years, I wish I knew. But absent any miraculous new technology (I don’t know, maybe cold fusion that can provide enough clean energy to suck the CO2 out of the atmosphere), the window for action has closed, and we need to focus on preparation.\n\nOh, and for those who are holding out hope that we’ll reduce carbon emissions and avoid “the worst of climate change,” global carbon emissions dropped by approximately 5% in 2020 because of the pandemic ([https://www.iea.org/articles/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2020](https://www.iea.org/articles/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2020)), yet we just passed a record 420 ppm in April 2022 ([https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/graph.html](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/graph.html)). To achieve any meaningful change to CO2 levels in the atmosphere, we need to be exceeding the 2020 level of reduction EVERY YEAR and sustaining it. GHG emissions reduction targets are woefully inadequate and are little more than a PR stunt IMO.\n\nThanks for reading my rant. Good luck out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the great comments. A few people asked/commented on what to do. Here are some of my insights:\n\n\\- If you want any chance to survive, mentally prepare yourself for the unimaginable trauma of seeing your whole world collapse.\n\n\\- Enjoy the time you have with the people you love. We may be living through the peak of human civilization.\n\n\\- You are not going to maintain your current standard of living in a post-collapse scenario. Even if you have the funds to create a self-sustaining replica, you will likely be unable to replace or repair the technology you are reliant on (solar cells, batter packs, refrigerators, pumps, etc.). Think of modern technology as a bridge to help transition to whatever lies beyond. I feel there's some good science fiction that seems paints a plausible picture, but can't think of titles.\n\n\\- Once our systems collapse, we'll essentially be in a pre-industrial society (ca 1800) with a few working pockets of modern civilization and limited remnant technologies. Learn how to grow and preserve foods, stockpile food and open pollinated seeds (most crops take 90 days to mature, so you need at least 90 days of food), get some resources on ethnobotany (most common weeds are edible or medicinal), wilderness survival skills, know how to disinfect water with a solar still, get some basic tools, get Where There Is No Doctor, look at how low tech communities live: how do people stay warm on the Mongolian Steppes, how do nomads in Saudi Arabia stay cool and get water, how do people with out gas or electric stoves cook. \n\n\\- Collect knowledge now, because once the grid goes down, we will lose access to the sum of human knowledge we now have at our fingertips.    \n\n\\- Don't talk about this at parties. It really kills the vibe!",

Also: COVID, insurgencies, debt, and more.\n\nThis is *Last Week in Collapse*, a long post I make at the end of every week, collecting some of the most important, sad, surprising, ironic, demoralizing, helpful, notable, timely, or otherwise must-see events in Collapse. \n\nThis is the 20th newsletter! Last week’s newsletter (April 30-May 6) is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ukh882/last_week_in_collapse_april_30may_6_2022/) if you missed it. You can also find these newsletters now [for free **on SubStack**](https://substack.com/profile/18092228-last-week-in-collapse), or sent to your email inbox.\n\nSri Lanka [is collapsing](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/10/sri-lanka-gives-emergency-powers-to-army-police-after-violence)—faster than expected. The Prime Minister resigned after weeks of protest; the military and police were granted emergency powers, and began detaining and shooting several protestors. Seven people were killed on Monday, and this is just the beginning. Some say [“Sri Lanka is the first domino to fall in the face of a global debt crisis”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/sri-lanka-is-the-first-domino-to-fall-in-the-face-of-a-global-debt-crisis). The bigger they come, the harder they fall.\n\nRussia’s economy [is looking bad](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seize-300bn-frozen-russian-reserves-063734391.html), expecting to drop 12% this year, undoing a decade of growth. Unemployment benefits, pensions, medicine, food…everything [is at risk](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61381241) of getting cut in Russia. A [Russian debt crisis](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/05/10/ftse-100-markets-live-news-inflation-cost-of-living-recession/) may be coming soon.\n\nAlthough Russia made no real territorial gains in the Ukraine War last week, there are always developments. American [intelligence suggests](https://news.yahoo.com/putin-ready-long-war-beyond-135737696.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) that **Putin may declare martial law, mobilize the entire country towards the War effort, and plan on a years-long slog intended to demoralize NATO and reduce Western interest** in maintaining their strong resistance & supply efforts. (Probably false) rumors say [Putin may have cancer](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/does-putin-really-have-blood-cancer-). One wonders how Russia can expect the West to lose heart [while their own morale](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3481944-pentagon-russian-military-continues-to-struggle-with-poor-morale-refusal-to-obey-orders/) is abysmally low. New Russian Revolution when?\n\nLithuania [called Russia’s wartime actions “genocide”](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1691202/lithuania-recognises-war-in-ukraine-as-genocide-russia-as-terrorist-state) against Ukrainians last week. What is Putin’s endgame here & now? If [~~Moldova~~ Transnistria gets involved here](https://www.vox.com/2022/5/9/23060272/ukraine-war-moldova-transnistria-russia-spillover), it will only widen the War, collapse Moldova, and prolong the suffering of everyone. Ukraine claims that [Russia deported 210,000 children](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-accuses-russia-forcibly-deporting-over-210000-children-2022-05-13/) into Russia, part of a forced assimilation project. One day they may be conscripted to fight in Putin’s War.\n\n[Click here](https://www.scmp.com/photos/world/3176797/pictures-ethiopias-worst-drought-40-years) to see pictures from **Ethiopia’s 40-year megadrought**. Despite having a dry year, [water use in California](https://apnews.com/article/business-california-los-angeles-eric-garcetti-66601e9026021c606109594235214f78) is up this year. Over [half of America](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/half-us-drought-wildfires-burn-tornado-activity-surges-rcna27976) (excluding Alaska) was in drought at the start of May. Drought has hit even [France](https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20220511-france-s-unprecedented-drought-shows-climate-change-is-spiralling-out-of-control). Check out the headline for [this article](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/desertification-droughts-reduced-india-s-gdp-by-up-to-5-in-20-years--82794) about drought in India; it still revolves around their GDP. Profits above all else.\n\nThe [Eurozone](https://www.ft.com/content/80fee86c-2633-4d48-b8cd-50ba9eb81e20) and the [Federal Reserve](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-down-investors-expect-massive-235403614.html) are raising interest rates, scrambling to maintain price stability. Bitcoin and [other cryptos are crashing](https://time.com/6175370/why-bitcoin-crashing/), too—even if the [civil-wartorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic_Civil_War) nation, the Central African Republic, [makes bitcoin a legal currency](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2319136-will-bitcoin-succeed-in-the-central-african-republic-probably-not/). \n\nAmerican debt levels [are rising](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/06/economy/consumer-credit-debt-march/index.html) amid **a stock market in free fall**, crossing an early checkpoint in the Long Collapse. The high tide [is receding](https://unherd.com/thepost/the-stock-market-crash-is-just-the-beginning/), and there’s no telling how low stocks, bonds, and other assets will go, or how long it will take.\n\nThe United States is planning [a few large oil/gas extraction operations](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/us-fracking-climate-fossil-fuel-gases) that could lead to record carbon emissions. These “carbon bombs” ~~could~~ will rocket humanity [past our tipping points](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas) and nothing you can do will stop it.\n\nChina’s handpicked candidate, the former policeman John Lee, [will follow Carrie Lam](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61267490) as the leader of Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s full integration into the Chinese Surveillance State is almost fully complete. \n\nWeek 7 of the Shanghai lockdown, and [restrictions are tighter now](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-61404082) than ever before. The head of the WHO [called](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/china/who-china-zero-covid-unsustainable-intl-hnk/index.html) China’s zero-COVID policy “unsustainable” but **China continues to crack down on COVID** to prevent from cracking apart. A breach in the strict policy [would kill over a million](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/lifting-zero-covid-policies-in-china-could-risk-16m-deaths-says-study) Chinese people, mostly elders. How long can China persevere in its steadfastness, and what will happens when/if it stops?\n\nNorth Korea admitted, for the first time ever, that [someone there has COVID.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/north-korea-admits-to-covid-outbreak-for-first-time) They said it was their first ever case. Kim Jong-Un said that North Korea is following a zero-COVID strategy, and began locking down all of its cities, preparing for quarantine, etc. But one day later, they admitted that a mysterious fever had [affected 350,000 people](https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-said-suffering-explosive-090548354.html). There’s no coming back from this, and this may complicate China’s relationship with their rogue satellite state.\n\nMore COVID: >! South Africa is experiencing [another surge](https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-africa-johannesburg-infectious-diseases-234a37538452d6aac417cb8413e6b1cd) in COVID. Reports emerged that say Pfizer’s booster offers [only weeks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/05/13/pfizers-covid-vaccine-protection-against-omicron-fades-just-weeks-after-second-and-third-doses-study-finds/) of protection against Omicron. It’s early, but some scientists [claim](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/05/12/national/science-health/japanese-researcher-omicron-hepatitis-children/) that COVID is behind all the hepatitis—liver inflammation—cases found among children recently.!<\n\nIn the Philippines, the frontrunner, and son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., [won his election](https://apnews.com/article/business-china-elections-presidential-philippines-07966d48907ea11a910d8aecbcb8db7b) as President, with outgoing President Duterte’s daughter as his VP. The incoming President’s father was [responsible for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_of_the_Marcos_dictatorship) thousands of extrajudicial killings, and tens of thousands of people imprisoned & tortured—not unlike President [Rodrigo Duterte’s record](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/04/duterte-worried-about-icc-he-should-be). \n\nAfter a Colombian drug lord was extradited to the U.S., the Gulf Clan, Colombia’s largest drug cartel, [took over about ⅓ of the country](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/12/terrifying-days-of-terror-under-colombias-gulf-clan-cartel) in an **“armed strike,”** grinding business to a halt from May 5-9. When a gang can flex its power across a country and not face serious retaliation from the government, it is functionally in a kind of irregular civil war.\n\nISIS militants made their most deadly [attack in Sinai, Egypt](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/9/isil-claims-attack-that-killed-11-egyptian-soldiers-in-sinai) last week, killing 11. The corrupt ruling government’s legitimacy is eroded by the insurgency in Sinai.\n\nAbout half the people in Afghanistan are [“facing acute hunger”](https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/record-levels-hunger-persist-afghanistan-people-require-humanitarian-assistance) this summer. That’s 20 million people in one remote nation going severely hungry. \n\nIndia now joined the growing list of nations [refusing to export wheat](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/14/india-blocks-all-wheat-exports-with-immediate-effect.html), adding fears to what we know is an oncoming **global food crisis**. For context, India produces a lot of wheat, but doesn’t crack the [Top 15 Wheat Exporters List](https://www.worldstopexports.com/wheat-exports-country/). The Top 5 are >!Russia, Canada, U.S., France, and Ukraine—though this year the list will be different…Meanwhile, [American wheat](https://www.hpj.com/crops/77-of-texas-wheat-in-poor-to-very-poor-condition/article_527426cc-d0aa-11ec-b63e-332fe87ca3c4.html) ain’t doing that well this year.!< And a [wildfire](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150691/the-largest-wildfire-in-the-u-s-has-burned-an-area-bigger-than-new-york-city) in New Mexico has burned across a space larger than New York City—and still expanding.\n\nIndia roasted under more heat waves this week. One tuktuk driver has found [an amusing way](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-india-61330402) to keep his vehicle cool while he’s driving. How will you adapt to everyday climate collapse—or will you just get baked?\n\nMore than [20,000 wild boars now live](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/picnics-banned-in-rome-in-bid-to-combat-wild-boar-incursions) in or around Rome, Italy. Curfews have been declared, and some people are mobilizing to cull them. Is this the kind of wildlife encroachment we might see during Collapse?\n\nIraq’s water reserves [are half of what they were last year](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/iraq/2022/04/21/iraqs-water-reserves-fall-50-per-cent-after-river-diversions-and-dry-spell/). This is a result of terrible drought, unsustainable farming practices, and Turkey & Iran damming up Iraq’s upstream tributaries to siphon the water for their own unsustainable farming practices. (Several years ago, I spoke to a certain US Congressman about Collapse, and he told me to look at Iraq and its water problems.) What happens when the other half of the reserves are depleted?\n\nClimate change is [interfering](https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-crisis-ocean-memory.html) with the “ocean memory.” Old patterns are changing, too much randomness has been introduced into the system, and we may see intense & unpredictable “marine heat waves” soon. More than half of the world’s oxygen [comes](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-oxygen.html) from the oceans. And don’t get me started on [underwater methane bubbles](https://www.wired.com/story/underwater-permafrost-is-a-big-gassy-wild-card-for-the-climate/).\n\nThings to watch next week include:\n\n➳ Finland & Sweden are likely to officially [join NATO](https://www.vox.com/2022/5/13/23069341/finland-sweden-nato-membership-russia-ukraine-war) soon, could be as early as this week. Sometimes I wonder if the Ukraine War has reinforced in the minds of observers certain illusions about the nature of War...\n\nSelect comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:\n\n-**The Everything Bubble has popped**, and is taking everything down with it. The stock market “lost” more “value” in the last few months than in any previous crash. [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/up8lsy/i_know_it_doesnt_feel_like_it_but_were_currently/) has comments of all shapes and sizes.\n\n-America is in a full blown mental health crisis. Probably your country, too, but [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/ulx052/we_are_in_a_mental_health_crisis/) is mainly about **America’s terminal psychological downspiral**. Great & thoughtful comments by r/collapse users.\n\n-We will never be able to reconstruct civilization after Collapse, according to [this guy’s comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/uklmq8/reconstruction/i7qcczh/) in a thread about rebuilding & recovery. Agree or disagree?\n\n-This [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/unfajc/if_you_could_design_and_build_a_new/) is a stimulating thought experiment about how you would design your own town from the ground up. Some of the responses are lousy, but it’s nice to think about.\n\nDid you like this Collapse Report?
