That one simple move would go a long way to forcing better city planning and organization, and make housing prices much more reasonable.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax\n\n>\tBecause the supply of land is essentially fixed, land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on landlord expenses. Thus landlords cannot pass LVT to tenants, who would move or rent smaller spaces before absorbing increased rent.\n\n\n>\tLVT's efficiency has been observed in practice.[18] Fred Foldvary stated that LVT discourages speculative land holding because the tax reflects changes in land value (up and down), encouraging landowners to develop or sell vacant/underused plots in high demand. Foldvary claimed that LVT increases investment in dilapidated inner city areas because improvements don't cause tax increases. This in turn reduces the incentive to build on remote sites and so reduces urban sprawl.\n\n>\tThe value of land reflects the value it can provide over time. This value can be measured by the ground rent that a piece of land receives on the market. The present value of ground-rent is the basis for land prices. A land value tax (LVT) will reduce the ground rent received by the landlord, and thus will decrease the price of land, holding all else constant. The rent charged for land may also decrease as a result of efficiency gains if speculators stop hoarding unused land.\n\n>Real estate bubbles direct savings towards rent seeking activities rather than other investments and can contribute to recessions. Advocates claim that LVT reduces the speculative element in land pricing, thereby leaving more money for productive capital investment.[25]\n\n>At sufficiently high levels, LVT would cause real estate prices to fall by taxing away land rents that would otherwise become 'capitalized' into the price of real estate. It also encourages landowners to sell or develop locations that they are not using. This might cause some landowners, especially pure landowners, to resist high land value tax rates. Landowners often possess significant political influence, which may help explain the limited spread of land value taxes so far.[26]","score":3,"date":1649103484}]},{"user":"conscsness","body":"585 comments on the reposted thread.\nNot a single top comment offers to organize and put an end to the atrocities.\n\nSo they are complicit, they are participating in exacerbating the issue that they suffer from.

At least 90 poultry flocks in the U.S. have already been given the bird, the bird flu, that is. Testing so far in 2022 has found highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in these flocks that span 22 different states. That’s as of April 1, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). And if you are planning to make an omelet anytime soon, expect to pay “egg-stra” for ingredients. Egg prices have gone up by 52% since this HPAI made its confirmed debut in the U.S. in February. So a dozen egg omelet is now going to cost you on average $2.88 for the eggs alone. That’s not including the cheese, onions, tomatoes. leeks, ham, hot dogs, chives, beans, salsa, pesto, avocado, love, or whatever else you may put in your omelets.\n\nRising chicken egg prices could affect your Easter festivities too since yoni egg hunts, hamster egg hunts, or some other replacement wouldn’t be quite the same. In other words, it’s hard to beat having real eggs at Easter events. And if you’ve been keeping abreast with chicken prices, you’ve probably noticed the recent upswing. The price of a regular back of chicken breasts, for example, has gone from on average $3.14 in the last week of March to $3.93 in the first week of April, which was significantly higher than the $2.48 that it was a year ago, according to the USDA National Retail Report.\n\nIn fact, expect everything poultry-related to be rising in price. As I covered for Forbes back in February, a number of farmers have been culling their poultry flocks in efforts to curtail the spread of HPAI. Around 17 million birds in the U.S. have already lost their lives as the result of the HPAI virus and HPAI control measures. This particular version of HPAI is the H5N1 influenza A variety. The “H” stands for hemagglutinin, a protein found on the surface the influenza A virus. There are 16 different types of hemagglutinin. The “N” for neuraminidase, another protein found on the influenza virus A surface, of which there are nine different types.\n\nHigh pathogenic avian influenza is different from your more run-of-the-mill avian influenza. “Pathogenic” means “causing or capable of causing disease,” based on the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition. Therefore, being called “highly pathogenic” by your date is not a compliment and probably not a good sign. This HPAI that’s been spreading is so named because it has proven highly capable of causing disease in birds. Therefore, if you are just noticing now that you have feathers and wings, the continuing spread of this virus may have your beak chattering. If you are human, though, the danger to you is probably quite low. During this current outbreak which has affected both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, only one human in the U.K. has tested positive for the virus to date.\n\nThis has already become the worst avian flu outbreak in the U.S. since 2015. And this clucking problem is likely to continue for at least a little while.
